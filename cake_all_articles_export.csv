"229","ESOPs for Cannabis Companies","<p end=""620"" start=""0"">
	By Alan Kandel &amp; Marshall Custer</p>
<p end=""620"" start=""0"">
	Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are gaining renewed attention in the cannabis industry as a promising tool for business succession, liquidity, and tax efficiency&mdash;particularly in light of the heavy burden imposed by Section 280E of the IRS Code. By allowing employees to become beneficial owners of the company, ESOPs offer a pathway to avoid federal income tax on corporate earnings when structured as a 100% ESOP-owned S corporation. They also offer the potential to defer capital gains taxes and deliver meaningful financial benefits to employees over time, while enabling founders to exit at fair market value.</p>
<p end=""1165"" node="""" start=""622"">
	But while the advantages are real, implementing an ESOP in the cannabis space isn&rsquo;t without serious challenges. Regulatory constraints, fair valuation requirements, existing debt obligations, and the need for cannabis-friendly financing can all complicate the path to employee ownership. Despite these hurdles, ESOPs may still offer one of the few viable exit strategies for cannabis operators in a tightening capital market. If done right, they can align ownership, incentives, and long-term company growth&mdash;but only with experienced guidance.</p>

"226","Evolving Case Law and Recent Legal Actions Influence Compilation of Boards of Directors of ESOP-Owned Companies","<p>
	The unique ownership structure of a company owned by an employee stock ownership plan and trust (ESOP) expands the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the ESOP company.<br />
	<br />
	Since the trustee of the ESOP acts on behalf of the ESOP (which is a shareholder) and the ESOP is subject to the rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the directors are subject to (1) the traditional state law duties of care and loyalty and (2) the duty to monitor the activities of the ESOP trustee and the plan administrator or ESOP committee (the ESOP committee is composed of management employees of the company that give the ESOP trustee directions to act on certain items).<br />
	<br />
	The Department of Labor and employees participating in the ESOP are the parties that commence legal actions against the directors for fiduciary duty breaches. Generally, director scrutiny focuses on the valuation of the stock of the ESOP company owned by the ESOP. Because of the expanded fiduciary duties imposed on directors and the increased fiduciary risk associated with serving as director, it is best practice to have the directors composed of the proper number and type of individuals, with certain committees established by the directors responsible for specific functions that assist the directors in carrying out its fiduciary duties.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Board Compilation</strong><br />
	<br />
	Because of the expanded fiduciary responsibilities and the importance to minimize &quot;conflict of interest&quot; and &quot;self-interest&quot; situations (which are prevalent in ESOP companies), the compilation of the individuals serving as directors is an important part in minimizing director scrutiny. Normally, it is best practice for an ESOP company to have five directors, with at least two of the directors considered independent. To the extent there are more directors, the number of independent directors should also be proportionately increased.<br />
	<br />
	Generally, a director is considered independent if the individual: (1) is not (and has not been for the three years prior to such director&#39;s appointment) a member of the management or employee of the ESOP company; (2) does not have any close family (or similar) relationship with the former shareholders that sold to the ESOP, another shareholder (i.e., if the ESOP is a less than 100 percent owner), another director or the management of the ESOP company, (3) has no material financial relationship with or in the ESOP company, a former shareholder, current shareholders, management or other directors, and (4) does not otherwise have any direct or indirect material relationship with the ESOP company, a former shareholder, current shareholders or management that may impair such director&#39;s ability to make independent decisions on behalf of the ESOP company.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Fiduciary Duties</strong><br />
	<br />
	Directors have two types of fiduciary duties with different standards of care:</p>
<p>
	&bull; The traditional state law corporate duties of care and loyalty, which are afforded the protections of the business judgment doctrine, and<br />
	&bull; The ERISA federal law duty to monitor (oversee) the ESOP trustee and ESOP plan committee.<br />
	<br />
	The duty to monitor is a higher standard than the state law duties of care and loyalty. It subjects the directors to a &quot;prudent man standard&quot; (and not a reasonable person standard) and does not afford directors protections under the &quot;business judgement rule.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	Under ERISA, the &quot;prudent man standard&quot; requires ERISA fiduciaries to act with the care, skill, prudence and diligence that a prudent person in such capacity and in such circumstances would act.<br />
	<br />
	The types of director actions that generally fall within the purview of the higher standard of the duty to monitor, based on case law and complaints filed in federal courts against directors, are as follows:<br />
	<br />
	&bull; The oversight of the activities of the ESOP trustee;<br />
	&bull; The oversight of the activities of the ESOP committee directing the ESOP trustee to take certain actions under the ESOP;<br />
	&bull; The oversight of the reasonableness of the financial projections and interim financial statements that are used by the ESOP trustee&#39;s valuation firm to value the stock held by the ESOP (including the ones used by ESOP investment banker in the initial transaction hired by the ESOP company);<br />
	&bull; The oversight of transactions with the former and current shareholders such as terms, components and conditions of (1) debt arrangements (including size of leverage), (2) governance rights and (3) future equity participation;<br />
	&bull; The establishment and reasonableness of management equity and other compensation arrangements that impact the ESOP;<br />
	&bull; Board procedures that address conflicts of interest and self-interested situations (such as the ESOP company leasing a building from a former shareholder at above market rate); and<br />
	&bull; The execution of engagement letters and agreements with the ESOP trustee and its valuation firm with contractual indemnifications that do not have appropriate limitations as to amounts and periods (i.e., an indefinite survival indemnification period) that could potentially cost the ESOP company millions of dollars in future indemnification obligations. Directors are becoming subject to director scrutiny because these types of contractual indemnifications are viewed as egregiously one sided, insular and incompatible with the ESOP trustee&#39;s exclusive duty owed to the ESOP and do not benefit the ESOP company or the ESOP.<br />
	<br />
	As a practical matter, directors should affirmatively demonstrate their exercise of the &quot;prudent man standard&quot; by (1) documenting their actions, (2) engaging and communicating with the ESOP trustee as may be necessary and (3) establishing committees to oversee the various activities of the ESOP company, ESOP and ESOP trustee.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Committees</strong></p>
<p>
	As a general matter, the directors should establish certain committees and designate a chairman for each established committee. The chairman will chair all meetings of a committee and set the agenda for each such meeting. If any member of a committee is conflicted on a certain matter, such member should abstain from voting on the matter.<br />
	<br />
	It is best practice for the Directors to establish the following committees:<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Audit and corporate governance committee.</strong><br />
	<br />
	This committee should consist of at least three members comprising of two independent directors and one director that is not the chief financial officer. The committee&#39;s responsibilities should generally be as follows:</p>
<p>
	&bull; To review and recommend to the directors the internal accounting, financial controls, accounting principles and auditing practices and procedures to be employed in the preparation of the financial statements and the financial projections used as part of the valuation of the ESOP stock, and the tax status of the ESOP company and related ESOP-specific tax status compliance testing (i.e., S corporation compliance);<br />
	&bull; To make recommendations to the directors concerning the engagement of independent public accountants (which accountants will report directly to the audit and corporate governance committee) and the scope of the audit or review of the financial statements;<br />
	&bull; To make recommendations to the directors relating to the performance of the ESOP trustee, the ESOP trustee&#39;s procedures in qualifying and engaging valuation firms and the ESOP trustee&#39;s transaction and valuation processes;<br />
	&bull; To resolve any disputes between any engaged independent public accountant and management;<br />
	&bull; To address and discuss questions of possible conflicts of interest of former shareholders, current shareholders, directors, members of other committees, senior executives and related party matters; and <br />
	&bull; To discuss, monitor and advise on the directors and omissions ERISA fiduciary policy (D&amp;O insuance), the ESOP trustee&#39;s fiduciary errors and omission policy, any litigation involving the ESOP Trustee and its valuation firm, and the ESOP company&#39;s other policies purchased to minimize risk exposure.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Compensation committee</strong><br />
	<br />
	This committee should consist of three directors with at least one independent director serving on the committee. The committee&#39;s responsibilities should generally be as follows:</p>
<p>
	&bull; To review, monitor and recommend to the board policies, practices and procedures relating to the compensation of managerial and executive level employees and related bonus plans;<br />
	&bull; To evaluate the performance of key executives and their compensation and obtain compensation studies supporting the related compensation amounts;<br />
	&bull; To oversee and monitor the ESOP company&#39;s equity incentive arrangements, such as phantom equity arrangements, stock appreciation rights arrangements, restricted stock arrangements and other employee incentive plans; and<br />
	&bull; To communicate with the ESOP trustee with respect to the ESOP company&#39;s equity incentive arrangements and review specific ESOP compliance testing relating to such arrangements.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	<strong>Nomination committee</strong><br />
	<br />
	This committee should consist of three members with at least two independent directors. Since ESOP trustees tend to be inactive and not involved in the operations of the ESOP company, the committee&#39;s responsibilities should generally be as follows:</p>
<p>
	&bull; To establish criteria for director membership (including experience, skill set and diversity); and<br />
	&bull; To evaluate qualifications, conduct background examinations, interview possible candidates and recommend the nominations of individuals to be considered for election as directors to the ESOP trustee and other shareholders.<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
	<br />
	The unique ownership structure of an ESOP company expands the responsibilities of the directors. Because of the higher standard of duties, the directors (1) should not simply rely on the work performed by the ESOP trustee to satisfy their fiduciary obligations and (2) should recognize that the directors&#39; interests and fiduciary duties are not always aligned with the ESOP trustee.<br />
	<br />
	The directors (1) should be composed of some independent directors, (2) meet at least four times a year, (3) establish committees to function in a proper manner and (4) be aware of the information used by the ESOP trustee in the valuation of the ESOP stock and situations in which &quot;conflicts of interest&quot; and &quot;self-interest&quot; may arise.<br />

"222","ESOP/Family Succession","<div class=""content"">
	<p>
		Over the next 10 years, over 50% of the privately held, family owned or ESOP&nbsp; businesses will be changing ownership.</p>
	<p>
		Are you one of them?</p>
	<p>
		What is your Plan?</p>
	<p>
		If you have the financial picture figured out, what about the organizational and management plan?&nbsp; Did you know that the most important value driver in most businesses and industries is management&#39;s capapcity to deliver on a promise?&nbsp; That means your company&#39;s value and worth is not what the balance sheet says it is,&nbsp; but is aligned to the future growth in revenues and profits that management promises to banks and to valuation experts.&nbsp; If your management team cannot live without the owner or CEO, then the value of the company drops like a lead balloon.</p>
	<p>
		We have entered into many companies where the finances and legal documents are all in place, but the business is&nbsp; declining or running into the ground due to lack of bench strength.&nbsp; We help companies avoid declines by engaging the management teams to improve performance and higher stock values. We are not financial advisors who sell financial products or business brokers who counsel owners in buying or selling businesses. We are Certified Managment Consultants, advising owners, boards, and C-Level executives on strategy, succession, and family or ESOP ownership issues.</p>
	<p>
		We know that no privately held, or family business is the same. We help tailor our approaches to each business, and apply common sense to the development of the next generation of managers and leaders. No family owned business is the same. While some companies have family members in the business, others do not. So what are the choices? Our approach is to develop choices to choose from while increasing the value of the company that leads to a successful economic transition from one owner to another. We are results oriented, with deadlines and milestones.</p>
	<p>
		The next generation of management isn&#39;t always the most obvious people. In some cases, the family members aren&#39;t capable to run the business. In other cases, they are capable but are not ready. Our approach is to develop as many people as possible, knowing that the &quot;cream&quot; will rise to the top, naturally. Our systems, tools and approaches enable competent people to develop the needed skills to successfully transition from one leader to the next. In some cases, an ESOP is developed to reward those people who helped build value for the owners.</p>
	<p>
		We have witnessed the difficulty of a singular CEO transitioning to a sibling partnership. If it was easy, more and more businesses would survive the transition. But it is NOT easy. We strive to improve the communication between family members in and out of the business as the transition unfolds. In some cases our goal is to develop the management team and create communications systems that reduce conflict. We are NOT family psychologists or therapists, nor do we provide family therapy. We are seasoned management consultants with clients who want to grow their business value and develop their next generation of management to provide a secure exit plan.</p>

	What will happen to the trucking company that you&rsquo;ve spent a lifetime building when you retire? Can selling to an ESOP make the transition of your company and the start of your retirement any easier?</p>

	The use of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) as a succession plan for trucking companies has become an attractive alternative to selling to a third party. ESOPs offer a variety of advantages, such as reducing tax liabilities for both the shareholders and the business and fostering a culture of ownership by rewarding employees for their service and loyalty.

"205","Empowering Government Contractors through Employee Ownership: Revisiting ESOP Benefits","<p>
	Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are the most common and successful employee ownership model in the U.S. and have become a popular alternative to traditional M&amp;A transactions for business owners looking to exit &ndash; either partially or completely &ndash; in a tax-advantaged structure that transitions ownership to employees over time. Among businesses that are classified as government contractors, providing some level of employee ownership has been accepted by both large and small players in the space. In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office <a href=""https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-514r"" target=""_blank"">found </a>that between 2014 and 2017, the Department of Defense issued almost half of its obligations (on contracts with annual obligations greater than $150,000) to companies that had ESOPs in place.</p>

	In addition to its well-known structural benefits, an ESOP can be an extremely attractive incentive plan for business owners who have a pool of strong managers willing to lead the company moving forward. Often, a sale to an ESOP can be more rewarding to the next generation of leadership than a sale to an outside party. Through an ESOP, the next generation of leaders can drive growth of the business while reaping the economic benefits of that growth through a management incentive plan (&quot;MIP&quot;), warrants, and ESOP share allocations.</p>

"203","Unlocking Liquidity: Selling Your Business to an ESOP","<p>
	An employee stock ownership plan &ndash; better known as an ESOP - can be an attractive and tax efficient alternative for owners of private companies that are seeking liquidity but do not want to sell to a third-party buyer. An ESOP is a qualified retirement plan that provides the business&rsquo; current and future employees beneficial ownership in the company over time. In addition to providing retirement benefits for employees, selling a company to an ESOP can be used as an exit or liquidity vehicle for the selling owner as well as provide tax benefits for both the owner and the company.</p>

"202","Why ESOPs Are Becoming More Popular Among Architecture and Engineering Firms","<p>
	Every year, the National Center for Employee Ownership (NCEO) publishes a list of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest employee-owned companies. In 2020, architecture and engineering (A&amp;E) firms accounted for 17 of these companies making the industry one of the most prominent on the list. Over 80% of those A&amp;E firms utilize an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) to achieve broad employee ownership, as opposed to other employee ownership options, such as worker cooperatives. An ESOP is a unique ownership transition tool that allocates a firm&rsquo;s stock to employees over time, capturing value attributable to future growth, motivating employees and empowering them to think like owners.</p>

"200","The Fallacy of the December 31 Closing for ESOP Transactions","<p>
	<em>While many businesses and their owners wish to close an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) transaction by or on December 31, the importance of doing so can be overstated.</em><br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	Many businesses and business owners contemplating a sale, merger or other liquidity event, oftentimes view closing a transaction before the end of the calendar year as important for a variety of tax and non-tax reasons, and ESOP transactions are no exception. As more and more companies discover the advantages of employee ownership, the number of new ESOP transactions closing on or just before December 31 continues to grow.</p>

"195","Business transition planning: Putting success in family succession","<p>
	The significant role that family businesses play in our economy is unmistakable: As of data from 2019, as much as 57% of U.S. GDP is attributed to family businesses that include both small local &ldquo;mom and pop&rdquo; storefronts and major public corporations (35% of Fortune 500 companies are family-owned or run). Despite these impressive numbers, only one-third of family businesses successfully transition to the second generation.</p>
<p>
	So what causes this high failure rate? Why does a business model that is clearly successful during initial and growth stages of a business fail when it comes time to pass along to the next generation?</p>
<p>
	Over the years, we&rsquo;ve worked with countless business owners transitioning what they have built to their children and other relatives &mdash; most with great success but some with significant disappointment. Two recent situations exemplify the drastically different circumstances and outcomes:</p>
<p>
	In the first example, our client/founder was passing his business on to his daughter, who had worked for several years in the industry after graduating from college. She had achieved success in various roles in sales and operations, and the industry was clearly a passion of hers. The business transition was gradual, spanning multiple years, until our client&rsquo;s daughter ultimately became president and CEO. Today that business continues to grow and thrive under its new innovative and enthusiastic leadership.</p>
<p>
	In the second example, our client/founder&rsquo;s son did not finish college or gain applicable industry experience. Instead he worked a series of short-term odd jobs until our client was truly ready (and anxious) to retire. Within six months his son was named CEO. Almost immediately key management began leaving, and the business quickly lost market share and profitability. Recently, we began working with this business again, but this time it was to sell it to an outside buyer for half the value at its peak.</p>
<p>
	When comparing the two side by side, it&rsquo;s easy to see why one failed and the other didn&rsquo;t. Common sense can prevent many problems, but even the most clear-headed owner can lose his or her good judgment when clouded by complex and emotional relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>
	As a business owner, guiding both individuals and the organization through a second generation succession can be a challenging and emotional process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Utilizing the &ldquo;five questions&rdquo; model presented in our&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.plantemoran.com/explore-our-thinking/insight/2017/05/business-transition-planning-the-five-questions-all-successful-plans-answer""><b>last article on business transition planning</b></a>, and considering how those questions and answers are different for a family business transition, might help you achieve the success of our first example.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Why&nbsp;are you planning to transition your business, and what are your succession goals?</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style: disc;"">
	<li>
		<p>
			Why are you considering a sale or transition? It is in your best interest? Is it in the best interest of your family members?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			What are your goals and what are your children&rsquo;s goals?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Do you want to have ongoing involvement in the business, and how might that help or harm the success of the next generation of leadership?</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Who&nbsp;is in the business transition planning picture?</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style: disc;"">
	<li>
		<p>
			Which children (or relative or relatives) are right for executive management and/or company ownership? Could some individuals have voting shares while others have nonvoting shares? Have you considered keeping ownership in the family but hiring professional executive management to run the business?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			What about other generations, siblings, spouses, etc.? How will those not right for executive management or ownership be cared for?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Who has the experience, interest, and financial ability to buy?</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>When&nbsp;should you plan to transition your business?</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style: disc;"">
	<li>
		<p>
			How does the changing value of the company impact the timing of your transition plans?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Should you speed up or slow down the transition based on age, health, economic outlook, or the next generation&rsquo;s readiness?</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>How&nbsp;do you successfully transition your business?</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style: disc;"">
	<li>
		<p>
			What does the technical succession process look like? Is it a full transfer or partial now and remaining later? What is the right structure for the business, stock, and any other assets that might support beneficiaries?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Have you considered the impacts of estate and inheritance issues, death taxes, legal expenses, cash flow needs, etc.?</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As a business owner, guiding both individuals and the organization through a second generation succession can be a challenging and emotional process. However, achieving this kind of success might be one of the most satisfying results. To do so, it is imperative to give serious thought to these and other questions early on, gather an experienced team of advisors who know both the &ldquo;soft-side&rdquo; and technical elements of business transition planning, and maintain communication with all key stakeholders throughout the process</p>

"186","COURTS CONTINUE TO RULE ON RETIREMENT PLAN MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS","<p>
	By: Gregory K. Brown and Louis L. Joseph </p>
<p>
	HIGHLIGHTS: </p>
<p>
	&bull; Some retirement plans, including employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), have in the past few years included terms and provisions that require participant breach of fiduciary claims to be resolved in arbitration on a participant-by-participant basis together with a class action waiver. </p>
<p>
	&bull; The validity and effect of these mandatory arbitration provisions have been challenged, and the courts are beginning to define the extent to which those provisions have effect. </p>
<p>
	&bull; Mandatory arbitration provisions are not a simple matter and should be adopted only after a plan sponsor has carefully considered a number of factors. ______________________________________________________________________________ </p>
<p>
	In the past few years, some retirement plans, including employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), have included terms and provisions that require participant breach of fiduciary claims to be resolved in arbitration on a participant-by-participant basis together with a class action waiver. This has been done, in part, to attempt to thwart the plethora of participant class action cases, particularly in 401(k) plan fee disputes, but also for ESOP breach of fiduciary duty claims. Predictably, this has caused the courts to begin to consider participant motions to invalidate or limit the effect of these mandatory arbitration provisions. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Recent Court Cases <br />
	</strong></p>
<p>
	Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the University of Southern California&#39;s (USC) petition for writ of certiorari to have it determine whether participants can be compelled to arbitrate claims of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) fiduciary breaches pursuant to agreements to arbitrate individual claims as part of their employment contracts. In University of Southern California v. Munro, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had previously held that the participants are not required to arbitrate their claims because the claims were brought on behalf of an ERISA retirement plan, not the individual participants. (See Holland &amp; Knight&#39;s alert, &quot;Ninth Circuit: Individual Employment Provision Cannot Compel Arbitration of 409(a) Claim,&quot; July 31, 2018.) This denial of the USC petition allows the participants to move forward with their lawsuit. </p>
<p>
	Last year, in Brown v. Wilmington Trust, a federal district court in Ohio ruled that that the breach of fiduciary duty claims of a cashed-out ESOP participant were not subject to a mandatory arbitration provision in the ESOP plan document that was adopted after the participant was cashed out. (See Holland &amp; Knight&#39;s alert, &quot;District Court: ESOP Arbitration Provision Doesn&#39;t Apply to &#39;Cashed-Out&#39; Participant,&quot; Aug. 13, 2018.) The Ninth Circuit is currently considering another ERISA arbitration case, Dorman v. The Charles Schwab Corporation, in which the retirement plan in question contains an arbitration agreement and class action waiver in its governing document. The district court in that case denied the plan sponsor&#39;s motion to compel arbitration and allowed the plaintiff to move forward with his lawsuit because the plaintiff&#39;s employment with the plan sponsor terminated before the arbitration provision was added to the plan document. Thus, the validity and effect of mandatory arbitration provisions has been challenged, and the courts are beginning to define the extent to which those provisions have effect. </p>
<p>
	<strong>Considerations for Plan Sponsors and Fiduciaries <br />
	</strong></p>
<p>
	Mandatory arbitration provisions are not a simple matter and should be adopted only after careful consideration. In particular, a plan sponsor should carefully consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: </p>
<p>
	&bull; What is the effectiveness to thwart class actions versus the risk of numerous participant arbitrations regarding the same subject matter and inconsistent arbitration awards? </p>
<p>
	&bull; Will the arbitration involve arbitrators with sufficient ERISA background and experience? Judges have a staff of clerks and research assistants that can dive into the law; arbitrators generally do not. </p>
<p>
	&bull; What are the potential time and cost savings derived from arbitration as an alternative to litigation? </p>
<p>
	&bull; What will be the effect on fiduciary indemnification and insurance coverage? Mandatory arbitration provisions may invalidate the fiduciary&#39;s insurance coverage. Arbitration awards in favor of plaintiffs may make it difficult for all fiduciaries (internal and external) to secure insurance. </p>
<p>
	&bull; What is the risk of an adverse arbitration award that is generally non-appealable? Arbitration is not the same as mediation. In mediation, the parties agree to bring their matter to a &quot;neutral&quot; third party to negotiate a settlement. Arbitrations often end up with some kind of award to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>
	This consideration should involve the plan sponsor and all affected fiduciaries. It may be more advantageous to include the provisions in a new plan than an existing plan where participants have accrued substantial vested benefits, but this has not been ruled on yet. In the meantime, the courts are likely to provide more definition and clarification on these provisions for plan sponsors and fiduciaries to consider.</p>

"179","Should an ESOP be Part of Your Succession Plan?","<p>
	If you&#39;ve spent most (or all) of your professional career building a small- to mid-size business, and you&#39;ve reached the point where you need to consider the &quot;exit,&quot; then you&rsquo;d be doing yourself a disservice if you failed to consider an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or &quot;ESOP.&quot; There are pros and cons to any plan, but an ESOP (1) has considerable income tax benefits (earnings may even become income tax free); (2) significant succession and estate planning advantages; and (3) can address concerns regarding a retiring owner&#39;s legacy. It is very common for contractors to use ESOPs to accomplish goals such as the ones mentioned above &ndash; only manufacturers use it more often. Studies have also shown that ESOPs can lead to greater employee productivity and retention, along with enhanced retirement benefits to all eligible employees. For contractors, it may also have a beneficial effect on surety relationships, as long as the lines of communication remain open; it&rsquo;s extremely important that all stakeholders (especially sureties) are involved in the process from the very beginning. In this article, we will address the nature of an ESOP, and the various benefits of using the plan as a succession planning tool.</p>
<p>
	Many owners want their children and/or key management to eventually operate and own the business, but they cannot afford to purchase the business (or cannot obtain adequate financing). ESOPs can increase the gradual direct ownership by the next generation without the need for personal financing, or the potentially conflicting goals or interference of outside, unrelated interests.</p>
<p>
	Most contractors wish to avoid potential business disruptions, not to mention the disruption to the lives of valued employees, which can result from an outright corporate sale. Whether it&rsquo;s a strategic acquisition by another business, or a financial acquisition by investors, your business may ultimately be moved out of the community where you&rsquo;ve spent years building ties or your employees may be terminated by new owners in an effort to cut costs. If your family&rsquo;s next generation had any interest in continuing to build your business, an outside acquisition could derail their plans. It&rsquo;s worthwhile to consider selling your shares to your company&rsquo;s new ESOP instead.</p>
<p>
	<strong>HOW THE PLAN WORKS</strong></p>
<p>
	The ESOP succession planning / exit strategy begins with the sale of the owner&rsquo;s corporate stock to an ESOP trust. The ESOP is technically a &ldquo;defined contribution&rdquo; plan, which is a tax-favored account under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). In effect, the ESOP borrows the funds for the purchase price (at full fair market value) from either an outside lender, or directly from the owner/seller who takes back a note; it&rsquo;s usually a combination of both. The company makes quarterly or annual tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP that the ESOP then uses to repay the debt incurred to purchase seller stock. Once the stock is purchased by the plan, it is held in a suspense account, and released and allocated to employeeparticipants based upon a non-discriminatory formula (usually based upon employee pay) over a period of years. This creates a significant long-term employee benefit plan that helps recruit, reward, and retain valuable employees.</p>
<p>
	If an employee leaves the company, the IRS mandates that he/she be granted a &ldquo;put option&rdquo; that is exercisable against the company. This means that the employee can sell accumulated vested shares back to the company, or the plan, for the fair market value at the time of retirement or other termination event. The value of the shares is determined on at least an annual basis. As employees leave the company, the company purchases shares on the participants&rsquo; put options, and retires the shares to treasury or re-contributes the shares to the ESOP (taking another fair market value deduction). Retiring the shares reduces the overall outstanding shares and increases the percentage of ownership that is held outside the ESOP by the owner&rsquo;s children and/or key management. Practically speaking, it is possible that when the last share is repurchased and retired, the shares held outside the ESOP represents 100 percent of the value of the company (i.e., the next generation / key management holds all outstanding shares).</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s important to remember that employees who accumulate stock in the plan DO NOT run the company or own the shares on an individual basis. The employees are &ldquo;beneficial owners&rdquo; of the shares through the trust, which is the legal owner of the shares. Aside from a few exceptions, the plan participants do not vote on the stock allocated to their accounts. The ESOP has a trustee who can be &ldquo;directed&rdquo; by management. A &ldquo;directed&rdquo; trustee may only vote the shares as directed by the board, leaving the employees with no voting rights or access to sensitive corporate information. Corporate governance and control (always an important consideration of business owners) can be maintained or designated by sellers, even in a 100 percent ESOP-owned company &ndash; at least until the debt is completely repaid (and all of the stock has been released from the suspense account). In short, day-to-day control of the company doesn&rsquo;t change, and control can remain with the selling owners until they receive the entire selling price.</p>
<p>
	<strong>FINANCIAL / BUSINESS / TAX EFFECTS OF AN ESOP</strong></p>
<p>
	The contributions made by the company to the plan to repay the debt incurred to purchase shares are tax-deductible payments of profit-sharing contribution expense, dollar for dollar. It is important to note that there are balance sheet items that can affect the net-worth or working capital ratios that are important to banks and bonding companies, so it&rsquo;s essential that companies communicate with these partners at the outset. You may be surprised to learn that in spite of the balance sheet effects of the plan, lenders and sureties will appreciate an orderly and gradual transfer of ownership that minimizes the disruption to company operations.</p>
<p>
	One of the most compelling benefits arising out of the establishment of an ESOP is the deferral (or possible elimination) of capital gains tax on the sale of the owner&rsquo;s &ldquo;C&rdquo; corporation stock, regardless of the owner&rsquo;s basis. Capital gains tax rates for individuals can normally be as high as 15 to 20 percent, depending upon the level of income; in addition, the 3.8 percent healthcare tax (called the &ldquo;net investment income tax&rdquo;) can result in up to 23.8 percent in federal capital gains tax (which doesn&rsquo;t include possible state capital gain taxes). However, under an IRC &sect; 1042 exchange, as long as the proceeds from the sale of the C-corporation&rsquo;s stock is then used by the business owner to purchase &ldquo;qualified replacement property&rdquo; (generally securities issued by a domestic operating corporation, with certain limitations), then capital gain taxes can be deferred. If the seller of the company&rsquo;s stock never sells the replacement property and holds it until death, the deceased security holder&rsquo;s heirs will inherit the replacement property with a &ldquo;stepped-up&rdquo; basis, and the capital gain will have been eliminated.</p>
<p>
	If the company is an &ldquo;S&rdquo; corporation (meaning you&rsquo;ve been receiving a Schedule K-1 every year after the company&rsquo;s tax returns have been prepared), then when you sell your stock to the ESOP, the annual Schedule K-1 will be issued to the ESOP instead of to you. The plan, as a tax-favored arrangement, is considered a tax-exempt trust (similar to a 401(k) plan), and is not subject to federal or state income tax. In essence, the company becomes a &ldquo;tax free&rdquo; entity. This is obviously a most beneficial situation, making the arrangement a very competitive succession planning option. No taxes mean MORE CASH available for operations, and usually more than enough cash to cover repayments on the original purchase loan. With proper planning, sellers and companies may be able to enjoy the distinct tax advantages afforded to both &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rdquo; Corporations.</p>
<p>
	Finally, ESOPs have been studied in depth for decades, ever since they were first created in 1956. These studies have proven that ESOPs can dramatically increase company performance in many areas. They foster an &ldquo;ownership culture&rdquo; in the company, which can make employees feel and act more like owners, and less like employees.</p>
<p>
	To summarize, here are some of the advantages of establishing an ESOP as an essential part of a succession plan / exit strategy:</p>
<p>
	<strong>SELLER ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
	<li>
		The selling shareholder may indefinitely defer or eliminate all capital gains on the proceeds of sale under IRC &sect; 1042;</li>
	<li>
		The seller can enjoy an immediate buyer of the seller&rsquo;s stock at fair market value;</li>
	<li>
		The seller can retain personal salary, perks, benefits and control without the interference of outside interests until the seller is ready to hand over the reins; and</li>
	<li>
		The seller retains personal and corporate legacy in the locality in which the company resides.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>CORPORATE ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
	<li>
		The company receives a dollar-for-dollar income tax deduction on the entire stock sale price, and enjoys an income tax deduction for the interest paid on external loans;</li>
	<li>
		An &ldquo;ESOP company,&rdquo; as a tax-favored entity, can be 100 percent federal and state income tax exempt; and</li>
	<li>
		ESOP companies outperform their peers with increased productivity and higher return-on-investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>EMPLOYEE AND COMMUNITY ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
	<li>
		The employees of an ESOP company enjoy enhanced retirement benefits of company stock with no out-of-pocket costs;</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP&rsquo;s orderly internal transfer of the company creates a more stable and reliable community employer, without the need to rely on the intentions of an outside buyer/ investor; and</li>
	<li>
		The company remains an important contributor to the community&rsquo;s social and economic fabric.</li>
	Given the extraordinary benefits involved in the use of ESOPs as a succession planning tool, and its common use within the industry, it would certainly be worthwhile to consider making an ESOP part of your exit strategy. BG

"173","Three Tips to Build Ownership Mindset","<p>
	To build an ownership mindset, we must engage employees. How to do it? Employee engagement is about honoring, recognizing, and uplifting people. It&rsquo;s about showing them they are valued and connected to something bigger than themselves that really matters. It&rsquo;s about bringing the spark that makes them special, unique, and priceless into the workplace.</p>
<p>
	By implementing small steps, you can make a real difference in how employees feel about their jobs and how much of themselves they contribute in the workplace.</p>
<p>
	Here are three simple things you can resolve to do this year to engage better with employees.</p>
<p>
	Communicate regularly: Keeping employees in the loop about the company&rsquo;s big picture and their role in it makes them feel valued and included, promotes a healthy attitude toward otherwise stressful changes, and helps ensure everyone is headed in the same direction. Whether you do it formally through newsletters, the company intranet, email blasts, text messages, or by just dropping by to talk, regular two-way communications create good will. Create a communications plan so those opportunities to share don&rsquo;t slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>
	Create peer-to-peer recognition opportunities: Peer recognition may be more motivating because it comes from the people who know exactly what it takes to do the job well. It&rsquo;s also more immediate and contextual than an annual or semi-annual review. Be sure to make peer recognition easy to do, frequent, public, and tie it to your company values.</p>
<p>
	Sponsor community service activities: Getting employees together to meet the needs of the world around you is a great way to strengthen relationships and make them feel good about working for a company whose concerns extend beyond its walls and its bottom line. Millennials, in particular, expect their work to connect them to something bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>
	This list is just a small sample of what you can do to make a big difference. If you need expert help with an employee engagement plan, give us a shout. It&rsquo;s what we do!

"170","ESOP's Tale","<p>
	It is no surprise the baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are looking to retire as they turn age 65 at a rate of 10,000 a day for nearly the next two decades.</p>
<p>
	Sixty-two percent of U.S. companies are planning to sell all or some of their stock within the next fi ve to six years, according to a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report.</p>
<p>
	It is projected to be the biggest transfer of wealth in U.S. history, estimated at $15 trillion or more during the next 15 years.</p>
<p>
	Pennsylvania is the sixth-largest economy in the country, with about 14,000 businesses in Butler County alone.</p>
<p>
	Many of these Pennsylvania companies fall in this baby boomer-owned category and are considering how to transfer their businesses and enjoy the fruits of decades of hard work.</p>
<p>
	An Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or ESOP for short, is an often overlooked method of business transfer as boomers look to do so in a way that best suits their families&rsquo; goals and objectives.</p>
<p>
	Many are family operations that would like to perpetuate the business into the next generation or to key management personnel but giving the business away is not a viable option, and the next generation often cannot afford or even borrow the purchase price.</p>
<p>
	The owner also faces considerable taxation on stock sale proceeds, including capital gains tax on the gain portion of the sale proceeds.</p>
<p>
	As of Jan. 1, 2013, the federal capital gains tax burden on a selling shareholder increases from 15 percent to 20 percent, plus 3.07 percent Pennsylvania capital gains tax. Additionally, the recently passed health care legislation imposes a 3.8 percent tax on the gain portion of a business sale, effectively making the combined federal and state capital gains rate on a sale of a business 27.5 percent.</p>
<p>
	ESOPs have unique procedural and tax benefi ts that are not affected by the tax law changes. Certain ESOP structures might not be subject to the underlying affected capital gains or income taxes at all. Therefore, ESOPs, in the right situation, can be one of the best and most tax-effi cient ways for a business owner to transfer a business and often provide the most net after-tax proceeds to the seller as compared to other transfer methods.</p>
<p>
	<strong>ESOPs defined</strong></p>
<p>
	In practical terms, an ESOP is a highly tax advantaged, immediate or gradual exit strategy for business owners desiring liquidity or to simply take &ldquo;chips off the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The ESOP is a &ldquo;ready and willing&rdquo; buyer of the seller&rsquo;s stock that keeps out unrelated third parties and allows corporate control to remain unchanged. It retains the seller&rsquo;s existing perks while providing signifi cantly enhanced retirement benefi ts to all eligible employees who will have a benefi cial ownership interest in the stock sold to the ESOP.</p>
<p>
	Technically, an ESOP is a defined contribution, tax-qualifi ed retirement benefi t plan under Internal Revenue Codes 401(a) and 4975(e)(7) and overseen by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Labor designed to invest &ldquo;primarily in employer stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>How an ESOP works</strong></p>
<p>
	Only ESOPs are allowed to borrow the funds required to buy the desired shares at fair market value from the selling shareholder.</p>
<p>
	Typically, the ESOP borrows funds from a bank, or the seller takes back a note.</p>
<p>
	The company makes tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP, which uses the funds to repay the loan incurred to buy the stock until the debt is repaid. The shares purchased by the ESOP are allocated to the employees of the company in proportion to their compensation as the loan is repaid.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Seller advantages</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The selling shareholder may indefi nitely defer/eliminate all capital gains on the sale proceeds.</li>
	<li>
		The seller enjoys an immediate buyer of some or all of the seller&rsquo;s stock at fair market value.</li>
	<li>
		The seller can retain personal salary, perks, benefi ts and control without the interference of outside interests until ready to hand over the reigns.</li>
	<li>

	The largest study to date regarding ESOP performance was a 2000 Douglas Kruse and Joseph Blasi of Rutgers University study that found that ESOPs increase sales, employment, and sales/employee by about 2.3 percent to 2.4 percet per year over what would have been expected absent an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	A more recent study in the Journal of Employee Ownership Law and Finance published in 2006 showed the return on equity of the ESOPs companies studied was 5.6 percent higher than comparable non-ESOP companies. It also found that the &ldquo;net&rdquo; profit margin was 10.3 percent greater in ESOP companies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Employee, community advantages</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The employees enjoy enhanced retirement benefi ts of company stock with no out-of-pocket costs.</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP&rsquo;s orderly internal transfer of the company creates a more stable and reliable community employer.</li>
	<li>
		The company remains an important contributor to the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Governance, control</strong></p>
<p>
	Stock ownership and control are not synonymous in an ESOP company.</p>
<p>
	In an ESOP company, the shares outside the ESOP appoint the board, which names the ESOP trustee. An ESOP trustee is usually a &ldquo;directed trustee&rdquo; voting as the board directs without the input of the employees.</p>
<p>
	The employees have no minority shareholder rights, access to financial information or voting rights.</p>
<p>
	Therefore, control can be maintained by a 1 percent owner even if the ESOP owns the other 99 percent.</p>
<p>
	Control is easily and affordably transitioned by gifting or selling the 1 percent, in this example.</p>
<p>
	<strong>ESOP&rsquo;s legacy</strong></p>
<p>
	Many owners want their children and/or key management to eventually run and own the business, but those individuals cannot afford to purchase the business nor obtain adequate financing.</p>
<p>
	An ESOP&rsquo;s &ldquo;legacy full circle&rdquo; increases direct ownership to the next generation over time without personal fi nancing and the potentially confl icting goals and interference of outside unrelated interests.</p>
<p>
	As employees leave the company for any reason, the company may repurchase the shares from the participants and retire the shares into treasury. This reduces the overall outstanding shares and increases the percentage of ownership that is held outside the ESOP by the children and/or key management.</p>
<p>
	In theory, when the last share is repurchased and retired, the shares held outside the ESOP represent 100 percent of the value of the company.</p>
<p>
	An ESOP is a ready and willing buyer and highly tax-advantaged business transition tool that is often overlooked because of perceived complexity or lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>
	An ESOP may be the ideal method to transfer a business on the seller&rsquo;s timetable to the next generation without the interference and costs of outside parties.</p>
<p>
	As the window of record low capital gains rates are set to expire on Dec. 31, boomer business owners owe it to themselves to explore their options.</p>

"169","ESOP: The Ideal Business Transition Option","<p>
	<strong>By: Daniel M. Zugell, CLU, ChFC, LUTCF and Samuel A. Landman J.D., LL.M.</strong></p>
<p>
	With 10,000 baby boomers (those born between 1946-1964) turning 65 each day for the next two decades, it is no surprise that most are looking to retire. According to a recent Price Waterhouse Coopers report, 62% of the U.S. companies planning to monetize their business will do so within the next 5-6 years. It is projected to be the biggest transfer of wealth in U.S. history, estimated at $15 trillion or more over the next 15 years. Many baby boomer owned companies fall into this category and are considering how to transfer their business and enjoy the fruits of decades of hard work.</p>
<p>
	Employee Stock Ownership Plans also referred to as ESOPs are continuing to gain strong momentum as baby boomers look to transfer their businesses in a way that best suits their families&rsquo; goals and objectives. Most are family businesses whose goal is to perpetuate the business into the next generation or key management, but giving the business away is not a viable option especially when the next generation often cannot afford or even borrow the purchase price.</p>
<p>
	The owner also faces considerable taxation on stock sale proceeds including capital gains tax on the gain portion of the sale proceeds. As of January 1, 2013, the federal capital gains tax burden on a selling shareholder increases from 15% to 20% plus an additional state tax burden of 5.4% on average. Additionzally, the recently passed health care legislation imposes a 3.8% tax on the gain portion of a business sale effectively making the combined federal and state capital gains rate on a sale of a business 29.2%.</p>
<p>
	ESOPs have unique procedural and tax benefits that are NOT affected by the tax law changes effective January 1, 2013. Some ESOP structures may not be subject to the underlying affected capital gains or income taxes at all. ESOPs are one of the best and most tax efficient ways for a business owner to transfer a business and often provide the most &ldquo;net&rdquo; after-tax proceeds than any other transfer method.</p>
<p>
	<strong>ESOPs Defined:</strong></p>
<p>
	In practical terms, an ESOP is a highly tax advantaged, immediate or gradual exit strategy for business owners wanting liquidity or to take everything off the table. The ESOP is &ldquo;ready and willing&rdquo; buyer of the seller&rsquo;s stock that keeps out unrelated third parties and allows corporate control to remain unchanged. It retains the seller&rsquo;s existing perks while simultaneously providing significantly heightened retirement benefits to all eligible employees who will have a beneficial ownership interest in the stock sold to the ESOP.</p>
<p>
	An ESOP is a defined contribution, tax-qualified retirement benefit plan under Internal Revenue Codes 401(a) and 4975(e)(7) and overseen by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Labor designed to invest &ldquo;primarily in employer stock&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How an ESOP Works:</strong></p>
<p>
	Only ESOPs are allowed to borrow the funds required to buy the desired shares at fair market value from the selling shareholder. Typically, the ESOP borrows funds from a bank or the seller takes back a note. The company makes tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP which uses the funds to repay the loan incurred to buy the stock until the debt is repaid. The shares purchased by the ESOP are allocated to the employees of the company in proportion to their compensation as the loan is repaid.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Seller Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The selling shareholder may indefinitely defer/eliminate all capital gains on the sale proceeds</li>
	<li>
		The seller enjoys an immediate buyer of some or all of the seller&rsquo;s stock at fair market value</li>
	<li>
		The seller can retain personal salary, perks, benefits and control without interference of outside interest until ready to hand over the reigns</li>
	<li>
		The seller retains personal and corporate legacy in the town in which he cares about and contributed to</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Corporate Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The company receives a dollar for dollar income tax deduction on the entire stock sale price</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP company can be 100% federal and state income tax exempt</li>
	<li>
		ESOP companies outperform their peers with increased productivity and higher return on investment</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Employee and Community Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The employees enjoy enhanced retirement benefits of company stock with no out of pocket costs</li>
	<li>
		An ESOPs orderly internal transfer of the company creates a more stable and reliablecommunity employer than the intentions of an outside buyer</li>
	<li>
		The company remains an important contributor to the community&rsquo;s social and economic fabric</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Governance and Control:</strong></p>
<p>
	Stock ownership and control are not synonymous in an ESOP company. The shares outside the ESOP appoint the Board which names the ESOP Trustee, in an ESOP company. Usually, an ESOP Trusteed is a &ldquo;Directed Trustee&rdquo;, voting as the Board directs without the input of the employees. Employees have no minority shareholder rights, access to financial information or voting rights. Therefore, control is able to be maintained by a 1% owner even if the ESOP owns the remaining 99%. Easily and affordable, control can be transitioned by gifting or selling the 1% in this example.</p>
<p>
	<strong>ESOP&rsquo;s Legacy Full Circle:</strong></p>
<p>
	The majority of owners want their children and/or key management to eventually run and own the business, but they cannot afford to purchase the business nor obtain adequate financing. ESOP&rsquo;s &ldquo;Legacy Full Circle&rdquo; increases direct ownership to the next generation over time without personal financing and the potential of conflicting goals and interference by outside unrelated parties. As employees leave the company for any reason, the company may repurchase the shares from the participants and retire the shares into treasury. This reduces the overall outstanding shares and increases the percentage of ownership that is held outside the ESOP by the children and/or key management. In theory, when the last share is repurchased and retired, the shares held outside of the ESOP represent 100% of the value of the company.</p>
<p>
	In summary, an ESOP is a ready, willing and able buyer and a highly-advantaged business transition tool that is often overlooked due to perceived complexity or lack of knowledge and understanding. An ESOP may be the ideal method to transfer a business on the seller&rsquo;s timeframe to the next generation without the interference and costs of outside parties. With the capital gains rates increasing dramatically, baby boomer business owners owe it to themselves to explore their options and the impact of waiting too long to learn the facts and take action.</p>

"168","Executive Benefits for ESOP Owned S Corporations Post IRC Secs. 409A and 409(p)","<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>History of ESOPs in S Corporations</strong> Daniel M. Zugell, CLU, ChFC, LUTCF Pete Shuler Fred H. Thomas <strong>History of ESOPs in S Corporations</strong></p>
<p>
	In 1996, Congress passed the Small Business Job Protection Act,[1] which allowed a trust associated with an employee benefit plan to hold shares of S corporation stock. However, it was only when the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 removed provisions discouraging ESOPs that these plans became viable for S corporations.[2]</p>
<p>
	As with other legislation, loopholes existed and some practitioners found creative ways to leverage the new law, sometimes contrary to the law&rsquo;s intent. One such loophole allowed a 100% ESOPowned S corporation to eliminate all federal corporate taxes and, in most cases, state corporate taxes, and direct a substantial portion of these savings into large benefit packages for the welfare of a select few.[3] IRC Sec. 409(p) is an antiabuse provision introduced by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 to close this loophole that allowed disproportionate benefits to a select few and eliminate perceived abuse of the law.[4]</p>
<p>
	The 2001 legislation imposed stringent testing to determine who benefits from the ESOP at certain levels. The law includes an expanded definition of &ldquo;family.&rdquo; It also defines equity to include most traditional executive benefit plans. These restrictions can give rise to a conflict between a company&rsquo;s desire to be an ESOPowned S corporation and its interest in employing common executive benefit techniques. Based on comments from the Treasury Department and those close to the legislative efforts, no legislative relief is currently being considered. For some companies, this may pose a threat to the longterm viability of maintaining both an ESOPowned S corporation and valuable executive benefits.</p>
<p>
	<strong>IRC Sec. 409A and Nonqualified Plans</strong></p>
<p>
	The American Jobs Creation Act[5] contained many provisions regarding taxes, estate planning, and nonqualified plans. To some, the Act was welcome news that finally provided longawaited guidance on the design of acceptable nonqualified plan provisions. It also provided a 12month window, which expired December 31, 2005, in which to bring existing plans into compliance. The major items addressed in IRC Sec. 409A and the legislation creating it fall into four categories: deferral elections, distributions, financing, and withholding/reporting.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deferral Elections</strong></p>
<p>
	Generally, deferral elections must be made prior to the beginning of the plan year, with two exceptions: 1) in the first plan year, participants may make elections during the plan year, within 30 days of their eligibility,[6] and 2) elections to defer performancerelated compensation that is measured for a period of at least 12 months may be made no later than six months prior to the end of the period.[7]</p>
<p>
	<strong>Distributions</strong></p>
<p>
	Generally, distributions are to be made as originally elected. Any subsequent change to a distribution election requires that the election take effect at least 12 months after the change. In addition, if the change of election relates to separation from service or change of control, the payment date must be deferred for a period of at least five years from the original date. There is an &ldquo;any occupation&ldquo; standard in the definition of disability.[8]</p>
<p>
	<strong>Financing</strong></p>
<p>
	Informal financing by a corporation to prepare for the contractual promise to pay, either with or without a rabbi trust, is acceptable. However, offshore rabbi trusts are no longer an option&#894; plans with offshore trusts will be considered funded and, therefore, immediately taxable. Additionally, financial triggers and early withdrawal &ldquo;haircut&rdquo; provisions have been either limited or eliminated.[9]</p>
<p>
	<strong>Withholding/Reporting</strong></p>
<p>
	The Act provides that deferrals must be reported on W2 forms at the time they are deferred, even though the deferred amount is not yet taxable.[10]</p>
<p>
	<strong>IRC Sec. 409(p) and ESOPs</strong></p>
<p>
	Once an S corporation with an ESOP has met Sec. 409A provisions, it must address the Sec. 409(p) antiabuse and related provisions. The purpose of Sec. 409(p) is to deal with inappropriate tax deferral and/or avoidance and to limit ESOP tax benefits solely to those companies that provide meaningful benefits to rankandfile employees.[11] In other words, the ESOP or its results cannot provide a disproportionate benefit to a select few, as defined by the legislation itself. The law prohibits any ESOP assets, or deemed assets, to be allocated to a &ldquo;disqualified person&rdquo; during a &ldquo;nonallocation year.&rdquo;[12]</p>
<p>
	A disqualified person is defined as a person who owns 10% or more of all deemedowned shares or is a member of a family collectively owning 20% or more of all deemedowned shares.[13] For purposes of Sec. 409(p), &ldquo;family&rdquo; includes an individual&rsquo;s spouse, ancestors or lineal descendents of the individual or the spouse, siblings of the individual or the spouse, lineal descendents of these siblings, and the spouse of any person described in this sentence.[14]</p>
<p>
	Deemed-ownership calculations include allocated and unallocated ESOP shares and &ldquo;synthetic equity&rdquo; but not direct stock ownership.[15] Synthetic equity has been broadly defined to include common corporate benefit and retention arrangements such as split-dollar plans, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, warrants, and nonqualified deferred compensation plans.[16]</p>
<p>
	A &rdquo;nonallocation year&rdquo; is a year in which all disqualified persons, in the aggregate, own at least 50% of deemedowned stock and direct stock ownership in the S corporation.[17] No ESOP assets attributable to or relating to company stock may be allocated under any qualified plan, including the ESOP, for the benefit of any disqualified person during a nonallocation year.[18] If any disqualified person receives any ESOP assets attributable to company stock or any benefit also considered under the expanded definition, it would be a &ldquo;prohibited allocation,&rdquo; and the company would be considered in violation of Sec. 409(p).[19] Additionally, shares of company stock, proceeds from the sale of such shares, and earnings on such shares that are held in the ESOP account of any disqualified person at any time during a nonallocation year are considered to be a prohibited allocation. Shares need not be added to an account during a nonallocation year in order to trigger a prohibited allocation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Penalties for Violating Sec. 409(p)</strong></p>
<p>
	The consequences for violating Sec. 409(p) are quite severe. Proper, proactive testing for this statute should be taken very seriously, as the ramifications of failure could be financially devastating, and the test must be passed every day of the plan year. The consequences of violation of Sec. 409(p) are as follows:[20]</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		The plan would no longer be deemed an ESOP, would lose the prohibited transaction exemption related to the ESOP, and would be subject to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT).</li>
	<li>
		In a nonallocation year, the company would be subject to a 50% excise tax on the fair market value of any prohibited allocation, which includes ESOP shares already in disqualified persons&rsquo; accounts at the beginning of the plan year.</li>
	<li>
		The company would also be subject to a 50% excise tax on the fair market value of synthetic equity held by disqualified persons in the nonallocation year.</li>
	<li>
		Each disqualified person would be taxed on the value of their ESOP account as if they had received a distribution of that account and, if the disqualified person is younger than age 59&frac12;, they generally would be subject to a 10% penalty tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Traditional Executive Benefits/Nonqualified Plans</strong></p>
<p>
	Nonqualified plans may include executives&rsquo; elective pretax income deferrals and/or corporate dollars. Depending upon the plan design, contributions may be made when the executive reaches predetermined goals and payable when the executive reaches retirement age or other benchmarks. By definition, nonqualified executive benefit plans are limited to a &ldquo;select group of management or highly compensated executives&rdquo; and are exempt from the vesting, reporting, and discrimination testing rules of ERISA.[21]</p>
<p>
	In addition, a nonqualified executive benefit plan can be tailored to each executive based on both the employer&rsquo;s and executive&rsquo;s needs. For example, the corporation may offer to set aside an additional 10% of Executive A&rsquo;s salary each year in which Executive A meets her sales objectives, until retirement. If Executive A remains with the company until retirement, she receives the cumulative benefit plus growth, if any. If Executive A leaves prior to retirement, the corporation retains the assets for other corporate uses. The potential forfeiture of accumulated benefits creates an effective incentive for Executive A to stay at the corporation (i.e. golden handcuffs). These plans are valuable recruiting and retention tools. In fact, the Clark Consulting survey of FORTUNE 1000&reg; companies, &ldquo;Executive Benefits&mdash;A Survey of Current Trends&mdash;2005 Results,&rdquo; indicates that 91% of the respondents have a nonqualified deferredcompensation plan in place.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Executive Benefit Planning Problems Facing ESOP S Corporations[22]</strong></p>
<p>
	PostSec. 409(p), many ESOP S corporations face a major dilemma. Traditional executive benefits such as nonqualified deferredcompensation plans, stock options, splitdollar arrangements, and stock appreciation rights are now included in Sec. 409(p) testing under the broad definition of synthetic equity. However, these types of executive benefit programs are vital to recruiting and retaining the key managers who are necessary for the longterm viability of the corporation. The passage of Sec. 409(p) may have a huge impact on companies that have plans in place for the benefit of the selling shareholder, spouse, or any family members. Many of these plans may have been implemented to compensate for the prohibition of family members&rsquo; ESOP participation due to the IRC Sec. 1042 election of a previous selling shareholder. In many instances, even in reasonable business arrangements, selling shareholders, family, and key management are prohibited from or significantly limited in receiving equity interests both inside and outside the ESOP. Many selling shareholders (potentially now considered disqualified persons) may have significant nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements that may be in jeopardy. Synthetic equity must be considered, not only for the executive and his or her family, but also in the overall calculations of whether the company is in compliance with the law.</p>
<p>
	Under Sec. 409(p) many S corporations will no longer be able to maintain both the ESOP and nonqualified executive benefit plans. This may create a significant shortfall in promised benefits to the selling shareholder, family members, and key executives. It is also a competitive recruiting and retention disadvantage for the ESOP S corporations that can no longer offer the benefit plans top executives expect. ESOP S corporations may have to seek alternative methods to recruit, retain, and reward key executives. Increased cash may be an option but has little golden handcuff retention value.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>
	The executive bonus plan may be an alternative that meets the executive benefit objectives of a corporation yet remains out of the reach of both Secs. 409A and 409(p). An executive bonus plan utilizing life insurance is a plan based primarily on IRC Sec. 162 (it is often referred to as a &ldquo;162 Bonus Plan&rdquo;). This arrangement is not a new concept, but since the passage of recent legislation, it has become a more widely used executive benefit program for S corporations that sponsor ESOPs.</p>
<p>
	The mechanics of an executive bonus plan are simple. The corporation purchases and pays for a life insurance contract covering the life of the selected executive. The insured executive owns the policy cash value and death benefit. The policy premium is treated as a bonus to the executive. Sec. 162, further supported by Reg. 1.1629 and Revenue Ruling 5890, allows the corporation to deduct premium payments if three conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		1. The premium is included as compensation to the executive (the executive must claim the premium payments as income).</li>
	<li>
		2. The total amount of compensation is considered &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		3. The corporation is not the owner or beneficiary of the policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Corporations could use any type of permanent life insurance contract that accumulates cash value for an executive bonus plan. Two popular types are flexible premium universal life and flexible premium variable universal life. These types of contracts allow the premium amount to vary and the payer may even skip a premium. However, the policyowner is responsible for maintaining enough cash value to cover the cost of monthly insurance charges and policy expenses. Premiums in excess of expenses accumulate in the policy&rsquo;s cash value account at a rate determined by either the carrier&rsquo;s general account portfolio or the separate accounts selected by the executive. Most quality flexible premium variable universal life policies offer a diverse mix of funding choices managed by wellknown investment managers. To provide the maximum taxadvantaged retirement income stream possible planners can design the policy to efficiently minimize the amount of death benefit coverage and maximize cash value growth (within tax law limitations).</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Specialty Executive Benefits Products</strong></p>
<p>
	Several insurance carriers offer specialty flexible premium universal life and flexible premium variable universal life products designed for the institutional market and generally used for the informal financing of deferred compensation plans. Several carriers allow these specialty products to be used for executive bonus plans. These specialty executive benefit products are generally designed to take full advantage of tax benefits offered through life insurance and usually feature</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle!important;"">
	<li>
		high early cash surrender values that are often 100% or more of the actual premium paid in the first year</li>
	<li>
		no surrender charges&#894; the owner can surrender policies for the full cash value</li>
	<li>
		insurance charges that may be calculated based on a mortality pool of executives and unisex rates</li>
	<li>
		low or no interest charges on taxdeferred cash values borrowed from the policies</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Roth IRA Tax Similarities</strong></p>
<p>
	In general, the tax treatment of an executive bonus plan utilizing life insurance can be compared to the tax treatment of a Roth IRA. The executive&rsquo;s contributions to the account (the premium) are taxable (per IRC Sec. 61) in each year that the corporation pays and deducts the premium (per IRC Sec. 162). Often the corporation will &ldquo;gross up&rdquo; the executive&rsquo;s bonus amount to cover the tax due on the premium. The unique tax treatment of life insurance can enable its cash value to grow income tax free and makes it possible to design executive bonus plans so that the distributions are not taxed to the executive and provide income taxfree death benefits to the executive&rsquo;s heirs (per IRC Sec. 101(a)(1)). Additionally, the executive bonus plan may provide income at the owner&rsquo;s discretion without the early withdrawal penalties of qualified retirement plans and nonqualified annuities or minimum distribution requirements of qualified retirement plans other than Roth IRAs. The executive bonus plan is especially appropriate since the executives who often participate in the plan generally do not personally qualify for a Roth IRA.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Creditor Protection</strong></p>
<p>
	The executive bonus plan can offer effective asset protection if properly arranged. Generally, corporate assets, including corporateowned life insurance cash values, are subject to the claims of corporate creditors. However, life insurance policies owned by an individual, like interests in employersponsored qualified retirement plans, generally are not subject to the claims of corporate creditors. Additionally, many states afford some personal creditor protection to life insurance cash values and death benefits. Practitioners should consult legal counsel as to their own state&rsquo;s laws regarding bankruptcy and personal civil judgment provisions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Study</strong></p>
<p>
	Paul and Sally Widget, both age 53, are owners of Widget Company, an S corporation in Texas. Paul&rsquo;s and Sally&rsquo;s accounts in the Widget Company ESOP each hold 9% of the stock in the ESOP. The Widgets&rsquo; participation in a traditional nonqualified plan (which is not a 162 executive bonus plan) pushes their deemedowned percentage to 9.9%. Paul and Sally also each own 25% of the total outstanding stock of Widget Company, with the ESOP holding the remaining 50%.</p>
<p>
	Any ESOP shares allocated to the Widgets would cause them and the company to be subject to adverse tax consequences due to the violation of Sec. 409(p). Additional contributions to the nonqualified plan for the benefit of Paul and/or Sally would also render the Widgets and the company subject to penalties. An examination of the Widgets&rsquo; situation will explain the impact of Sec. 409(p) on them and their company.</p>
<p>
	First, since the Widgets are each on the edge of owning 10% of all deemedowned shares (which considers ESOP shares and synthetic equity due to the nonqualified plan) of an S corporation, the Widgets will be designated disqualified persons under Sec. 409(p) if they receive more ESOP shares or more under the nonqualified plan. Second, when their outright stock ownership is combined, the Widgets own 50% of all deemedowned company stock. Therefore, any allocation of ESOP shares or contributions to the nonqualified plan (synthetic equity) for Paul and Sally would cause the company to violate the antiabuse provisions of Sec. 409(p) and subject them to the penalties outlined above.</p>
<p>
	To avoid violating Sec. 409(p), the Widgets decided to implement an executive bonus plan for themselves using a specialty executive benefit life insurance product. The amount of each executive bonus equals the sum of 1( the value of what each executive would have been granted in ESOP shares, 2( an amount equal to the amount that would have been contributed to the nonqualified plan on each individual&rsquo;s behalf, and 3( any desired additional contributions.</p>
<p>
	Paul&rsquo;s and Sally&rsquo;s contributions equaled $60,000 each, which purchased a minimum, nonMEC death benefit of $908,520 each. Assuming annual contributions continue until age 65, with the Widgets managing the investment options to achieve a taxdeferred 8% gross rate of return each year, each policy&rsquo;s cash value at age 65 is projected to equal $945,88923 and would support a taxfree income stream of $78,668 per year for 20 years. Since the Widgets personally own the insurance, the cash value and death benefit are protected from corporate creditors. Because the state of Texas offers additional protection, the cash value and death benefit are also protected from Paul&rsquo;s personal creditors. Paul views the executive bonus plan as a Roth IRA lookalike strategy to the extent that the taxation is similar.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
	Due to the new stringent Secs. 409(p) and 409A provisions, S corporations with ESOPs could lose key executives to competitors that do not have ESOPs, and Sec. 409(p) also significantly limits family members&rsquo; access to familycreated wealth.</p>
<p>
	The executive bonus plan is an alternative that can meet many, if not all, of the S corporation&rsquo;s objectives and remain outside the scope of both Secs. 409A and 409(p). The executive bonus plan provides significant tax advantages afforded only to life insurance. This Roth IRA lookalike provides an aftertax vehicle that potentially grows tax free, provides retirement income tax free, and ultimately pays a taxfree death benefit to heirs. The executive bonus plan is not subject to corporate creditors and, in many states, not subject to personal creditors.</p>
<p>
	In summary, the executive bonus plan can be an ideal solution for S corporations, either partially or wholly owned by an ESOP, that wish to recruit, reward, and retain family members and key executives andmaintain the longterm viability of the ESOP.</p>

"167","EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP BILLS GAIN MOMENTUM","<p>
	Two bills have been recently introduced in the United States Congress to promote employee ownership to perpetuate American businesses and provide retirement security to the American workforce. Both H.R. 2096 and S. 1212 bills are titled &ldquo;Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2015&rdquo; and aim to enhance the already significant tax-advantages of Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):</strong></p>
<p>
	An ESOP is a tax-qualified retirement benefit plan that provides an immediate buyer of company stock at fair market value for owners desiring liquidity with many personal and corporate tax advantages while providing significant retirement benefits to all eligible employees. ESOPs allow a selling shareholder to indefinitely defer federal capital gains taxes on the sale of stock, provides a 100% corporate deduction of the value of the stock sold, may result in corporate profits being 100% federal and state income tax exempt, does not disturb corporate control and keeps the business in the family or with key management who generally can&rsquo;t buy the business on their own.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How an ESOP works:</strong></p>
<p>
	Typically, the ESOP borrows funds from a bank and/or the seller takes back a note. The company makes taxdeductible contributions to the ESOP which uses the funds to repay the loan incurred to buy the stock. The shares purchased by the ESOP are allocated to employees of the company as the loan is repaid. The employees &ldquo;cash in&rdquo; their shares upon retirement or other qualifying event.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Proposed Legislation:</strong></p>
<p>
	H.R. Bill 2096 was introduced on April 29, 2015 and as of this writing has fifty-three co-sponsors (36-R/17-D). S. 1212 was introduced on May 6, 2015 and has twenty-six co-sponsors (14-R/10-D/2-I).</p>
<p>
	Both bills allow sellers of S Corporation stock to enjoy the same indefinite capital gains tax deferral currently available only to sellers of C Corporation stock to an ESOP under IRC 1042 provided the sale proceeds are reinvested into qualifying U.S. stocks and bonds. Current effective federal capital gains tax rates are up to 23.8% plus applicable state rates.</p>
<p>
	Both bills also address the provisions of the Small Business Act that threatened the preferential status of certain businesses such as women-owned and minority-owned businesses if more than 49% of the stock is sold to an ESOP. The bills propose that if the other qualifying provisions regarding racial, gender or other criteria are met, preferential status treatment will not be lost solely due to a sale to an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	H.R. 2096 additionally seeks to replace a similar, previously expired provision that incentivizes banks to lend for ESOP purposes. Banks will not have to pay tax on 50% of the interest income they collect on loans extended for ESOP purposes if passed.</p>
<p>
	In summary, ESOPs are gaining momentum due to the continued bi-partisan support for employee ownership as well as the tremendous numerous tax and other advantages making an ESOP worthy of your exit planning consideration.</p>

This can be accomplished by seeking an independent valuation firm for purposes of establishing the fair market value of the sponsor&#39;s stock, since a business appraisal is required <em>each time </em>the price of ESOP shares is determined. Because of recent regulatory pressures, ESOP trustees should reinforce this procedure by implementing a peer-review process for ESOP valuation reports.</span></p>

color:#414142"">While the trustees typically perform significant due diligence in the initial selection of a business appraiser for purposes of determining the fair market value of the ESOP company stock, not enough may be done once the appraiser is selected. As important as the first valuation report is, the importance of annual valuations of an ESOP cannot be underestimated. Future transactions for all ESOP participants, after all, are based on the annual valuation determined by the selected appraiser. The appraiser&#39;s role is to be an advisor to the ESOP trustee. The trustee has the responsibility to determine the price of shares of company stock. The valuation report is merely a recommendation. The trustee can either accept or reject that value. To have confidence in making such a recommendation, the trustee should be very diligent about the review of the valuation report and clarify any questions that surface upon review, prior to determining the ESOP share price.</span></p>

As most anyone in a professional capacity would agree, a second set of eyes picks up things that the first set of eyes may miss. Periodically having an independent appraiser review a business valuation report is a healthy exercise and is a prudent step to take when an ESOP is in place. This additional due diligence is essential for a trustee performing his or her duties as an ERISA fiduciary, with the interest of the plan&#39;s participants/beneficiaries in mind. At worst, it will add a nominal amount of professional fees every few years to administer the ESOP. The best-case scenario is that an error, inconsistency, or improper use of methodology will be pointed out during the review process whose correction could have a material impact on the share price of the ESOP&#39;s stock. This can greatly reduce the possibility of litigation in the future.</span></p>

In addition, the fact that the trustee is a fiduciary to those ESOP participants certainly increases the stakes to the trustee.</span></p>

color:#414142"">The question is this: Should ESOP trustees not have a similarly rigorous process in place for the valuation reports that they obtain, and rely on, from third-party valuation firms? Would that not solve many issues that go beyond accuracies, methodologies, and solid report writing? It seems that it would also bode very well for trustees, in that they are complying with their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the plan&#39;s participants and beneficiaries. In addition to further ensuring that the valuations are being done properly, it will answer the question of whether the business appraiser is independent. It is an appraiser&#39;s duty to adhere to the standards of his or her appraisal-certifying organizations, which require their opinions of value to be impartial and unbiased. However, in performing this extra step (of hiring a third-party valuation firm for review purposes), the trustee would be following prudent procedures to do everything in his or her power to assure the ESOP participants that there is objectivity and independence in place pertaining to the selected appraiser when an independent peer review is part of the process.</span></p>

Employee Stock Ownership Plan, allegedly allowed the plan to purchase stock from Sierra Aluminum&#39;s co-founders and top executives for more than fair market value. After years of negotiations, the DOL reached a settlement with GreatBanc Trust. According to Secretary of Labor Thomas E.

The DOL has been searching for ways of making those professionals who provide valuation advice more accountable for the valuations prepared for ESOPs. In October 2010, the DOL released a definition of the term &quot;fiduciary.&quot; The proposal was published in the <i>Federal Register, </i>and, in essence, it more broadly defines a fiduciary by including those who provide investment advice to an employee benefit plan or a plan&#39;s participants. As it relates to the valuation community, the definition included valuation appraisers as fiduciaries. In a news conference announcing a proposed rule regarding the definition of fiduciaries for ESOP purposes, the DOL stated in response to the question of who the proposed rule would affect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

	<span style=""font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#414142"">In 1976, the Department issued guidance that said that appraisers that were providing valuations for ESOPs were not fiduciaries under ERISA. This regulation would change that and the reason is that the appraisers who give a valuation for an ESOP transaction are clearly providing advice that they know everyone is going to rely on, that&#39;s why they are hired, and there have been many, many examples of abusive transactions in this regard where the appraisal is faulty, where they overvalue the employer&#39;s stock.</span></p>

	<span style=""font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:#414142"">The professionals who provide valuation/investment advice to the ESOP community resisted this effort on the part of the DOL, and, in 2011, the DOL withdrew the proposed rule, as originally drafted. It was unclear whether it would resurface in the rereleased version. As of the writing of this article, the DOL will not include the proposed rule in its planned rerelease of the broader fiduciary rule. However, whether the DOL will be successful in future proposed rules regarding named fiduciaries remains to be seen. Nevertheless, one message is loud and clear: If proactive efforts are not made to address this concern, a governing body will make rules and we will all need to live with those rules pertaining to additional risks and liabilities for professionals in the ESOP field. One viable solution is to incorporate a peer-review process for ESOP valuations similar in nature to the process for valuations completed for financial reporting purposes. Perfection, by any measure, is difficult to attain. An assignment that includes judgment, lengthy reports, numerous computations, and - lest we forget - objectivity is a challenging proposition. However, broken down into its parts, a good valuation report should have clarity, transparency, and should use accepted methodologies to arrive at a defensible valuation. A trustee&#39;s job is to make certain that is the case. A peer review will provide a secondary level of assurance in that process. </span><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

"160","ESOPs - Recycling Stock vs. Retiring It","<p>
	When a former employee is being paid his stock from an ESOP, and he has the right to &quot;put&quot; the shares back to the company or the plan, the company often has to make a tough decision --- Do we retire (redeem) the shares (buying them back into the corporation&#39;s treasury stock) or recycle the shares (having them bought back by the ESOP). Here are thoughts to consider on the two approaches.</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: upper-alpha!important;"">
	<li>
		Recycle
		<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal!important;"">
			<li>
				With ongoing contributions, the ESOP can buy back the shares from former employees and thus have new shares to allocate each year to all participants.</li>
			<li>
				Without recycling, for many plans the only way shares would get into the accounts of new participants would be if there are forfeitures from the accounts of participants who are terminating employment. However, the ones that have short tenure, and thus forfeit part of their accounts, are also the ones with small accounts. So there may not be much in the way of forfeitures to be reallocated.</li>
			<li>
				If the ESOP is buying back the shares, often it can do so by liquidating the shares and spreading the distribution over several years. The downside is that cash for shares liquidated at a future date must be based on the future price per share. Doing something comparable while redeeming stock requires a reasonable interest rate and the use of some collateral other than the shares themselves.</li>
			<li>
				If the amount to be bought back can be handled with the amount the company wishes to contribute for the year, then recycling makes a lot of sense.</li>
			<li>
				Participant taxation
				<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha!important;"">
					<li>
						Another advantage to recycling is that whether the benefit is distributed in a lump sum or through installments, the participant can always choose to have the distributed shares (if the employer is a C corporation) or cash go into an IRA.</li>
					<li>
						If the put is honored, instead, by the corporation through installment payments, then those payments made beyond 60 days after the ESOP distribution are not eligible for rollover into an IRA.</li>
					<li>
						If the put is honored by the plan, as a lump sum distribution, then the participant has the ability to tax Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) at capital gains rates. This does not apply to installment distributions since NUA treatment requires a total lump sum distribution.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				If the amount to be bought back exceeds the cash available from the plan and the current year&#39;s contribution, then the company might consider
				<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha!important;"">
					<li>
						A combination of recycling and redeeming;</li>
					<li>
						Re-leveraging the ESOP to borrow more cash to be paid for with future contributions; or</li>
					<li>
						Using some combination of (a) and (b) in order to &quot;smooth&quot; the cash needs of the plan.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Redeem and retire
		<ol style=""list-style-type: decimal"">
			<li>
				In general
				<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha!important;"">
					<li>
						How do new participants get any stock credited to their accounts?</li>
					<li>
						Redemption is often part of a long-term strategy to wind down the ESOP.</li>
					<li>
						If there will be no more contributions, then the plan could be deemed &quot;terminated&quot; requiring full vesting of all participant accounts.</li>
					<li>
						Oftentimes, a redemption is not expected to decrease the price per share because the cash going out to purchase the shares is offset by a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. The resulting ratio of value to number of shares can remain the same. But not all appraisals reach that same result.</li>
					<li>
						If the corporation is buying back the shares, doing so through installments requires a reasonable interest rate and collateral other than the shares themselves.</li>
					<li>
						If the shares are expected to appreciate faster than the cost of borrowing money, then (assuming legitimate collateral is available), retiring the shares with installment payments might lower the ultimate cost to the employer. This needs to be weighed against the loss of deduction, if any, by using the recycling method.</li>
					<li>
						Will the shares bought by the corporation eventually be contributed to the ESOP at some later date?</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				S corporations wholly owned by the ESOP
				<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha!important;"">
					<li>
						If the company is an S corporation then usually former employees are not even allowed to own stock. Consequently, the participant doesn&#39;t have a &quot;put&quot; option. In these cases most companies use the recycling approach. A very small percent of companies in this situation get around this by having the company buy shares from the ESOP (requiring a lot of effort to avoid a prohibited transaction), and then have the ESOP pay the former employee.</li>
					<li>
						For small S corporation ESOPS, constantly retiring the shares means the participants in the plan own an ever-increasing percent of the company. For the people with the largest balances, this could create anti-abuse problems (under Section 409(p) of the Code).</li>
					<li>
						Retiring shares and later re-contributing those shares to the ESOP does not generate any meaningful deduction if the company is 100% owned by the ESOP.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Situations other than S corporations wholly owned by the ESOP
				<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha!important;"">
					<li>
						If this is not an S corporation wholly owned by the ESOP, then buying back shares at one price in Year X, but contributing them in a later Year Y at a higher price, not only gives a Year Y deduction higher than the cash spent on the buy-back, but allows a Year Y deduction without contributing any cash at all.</li>
					<li>
						Redeeming shares does not offer a deduction for the transaction, while contributing to the ESOP and having the ESOP purchase the same shares, can be deductible.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				Participant taxation

"159","Employee Stock Ownership Plans and ""Rebalancing""","<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">What is rebalancing?</span></u></b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">&nbsp; It is peculiar to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs).&nbsp; In its Response to Technical Assistance Request (#4) (<a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/esop_tar4_022310.pdf""><span style=""color:black;mso-style-textfill-fill-color:black;mso-style-textfill-fill-alpha:
100.0%"">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/esop_tar4_022310.pdf</span></a>), issued April, 2009, the IRS has said &quot;&hellip; we define <i><u>rebalancing</u></i> as the mandatory transfer of employer securities into and out of participant plan accounts, usually on an annual basis, designed to result in all participant accounts having the same <i><u>proportion</u></i> of employer securities.&quot;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Where is it applicable?</span></u></b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">&nbsp; First of all, it is only applicable to an ESOP that has &quot;other investments&quot; in <i>addition</i> to employer stock.&nbsp; Some plans allocate new shares (or newly released shares as an exempt loan is paid off) to the participants each year.&nbsp; After a while, all the shares are purchased and allocated; and <i>new</i> participants only share in the allocation of new cash contributions or forfeitures attributed to other participants terminating employment.&nbsp; The employees who have been with the company since the ESOP was established could be, for example, 95% invested in company stock, while those who have been in the plan only a couple of years might be, for example, only 10% invested in company stock.&nbsp; Anticipating this problem down the road, some employers put a provision in their ESOP so that the allocation of all assets is in a &quot;pooled&quot; approach whereby all participants are invested proportionately the same in company stock.&nbsp; So, for example, there could be a year for which (instead of some people being 95% in company stock and others being 10% in company stock) all participants are 85% invested in company stock.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Advantages</span></u></b><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">:&nbsp; Now that rebalancing is blessed by the IRS, why use it?&nbsp; There are several advantages to such a provision.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">It results in all participant balances being proportionately the same.&nbsp; In other words if every participant&#39;s account is 85% in company stock and 15% in other investments, then every participant&#39;s yield on his prior year-end balance is the same percent.&nbsp; It avoids cases where there can be dramatic differences in yields seen by participants &ndash; such as when the company stock increases 25%, the other assets earn only 5%, and rebalancing is <i>not</i> being used.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">It is sometimes thought of, and communicated to participant as, a forced diversification.&nbsp; So, even though participants will have the right at age 55 with 10 years of participation to start diversifying out of company stock, this provision might create additional diversification at an earlier point in time.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Rebalancing provides an &quot;equal incentive and reward&quot; to all participants, when you look at the yield on their ESOP account balances.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Disadvantages</span></u></b><span style=""font-size:
12.0pt"">:&nbsp; What are perceived above as advantages from one person&#39;s point of view can be seen as a disadvantage from another&#39;s point of view.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">Unless rebalancing is put in the plan when established and communicated properly, the people who have some shares taken out of their accounts in order to accommodate rebalancing will perceive it as a &quot;take-away&quot; if the company stock consistently performs better than the other assets.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">It complicates administration (and communication to participants) to have rebalancing interact with other required provisions &ndash; e.g., the rule that at age 55 with 10 years of participation, the participant has some <i><u>optional</u></i> diversification.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">If an ESOP has other assets, would the employer wish, instead, to purchase shares from <i>former</i> employees who have not yet been paid their benefits, thus maximizing the company stock held by <i>current</i> employees?&nbsp; Of course this could be seen as a disadvantage to the former employee who chooses to leave a balance in the plan until retirement age.&nbsp; However, the IRS has also given its blessing to such provisions, now called &quot;reshuffling&quot;.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""font-size:12.0pt"">The only ESOPs that can <i>preclude</i> a distribution in company stock are those sponsored by S corporations and those sponsored by companies whose by-laws require that non-ESOP shares can only be held by employees. For other ESOPs, the participant must have the right to a distribution in employer securities.&nbsp; Consequently, even if the funds are taken out of company stock at a participant&#39;s termination of employment, the former employee who later requests a distribution could request that it be in the form of company stock.&nbsp;</span></p>

	Sometimes, families working in the business have conflicts caused by the differences with behaviors and expectations.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Some of these family business conflict stories show up as great novels and news articles.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Have you heard of children who can no longer work with each other, and they are partners due to estate planning by Mom and Dad?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>How about the son or daughter who is CEO, and has partners who are siblings and don&rsquo;t think the CEO is running the company well?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, Dad is struggling with a difficult business environment, cause by the employed children who aren&rsquo;t performing well.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Or Dad is still running the business while in his late 70&rsquo;s and the employed children have lost interest in the business.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There are so many stories, and sadly, many never get solved, don&rsquo;t reconcile or they cause further harm.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>This article is about how ESOPs can help solve the ownership issues.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	When a company is owned by person, with family members and distant relatives employed in the business, a set of behaviors develop that are commonly described as a &ldquo;Family Business.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>When you look at family systems, and compare them to the business behaviors or systems, which typically is blended and managed, you can help pinpoint the causes of family conflict in the business and develop remedies.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The underlying theme is &ldquo;whole is greater than the sum of the parts.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>ESOPs are a great remedy for many family business issues that surface when conditions or expectations change.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	To understand the challenges, one needs to understand the differences between Family systems and Businesses systems, as they relate to a systems/behavioral approach.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Family behaviors usually involve some level of emotion; have an inward focus with interdependencies and relationships/alliances; prefer retaining traditions which typically minimize or restrict change; typically desire to have unconditional acceptance of each other, which then causes misbehavior to be regularly overlooked; and the family&rsquo;s task includes nurturing each other, growing self-esteem and preparing the family members to become mature adults.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Business System behaviors, in contrast to family system behaviors, seek rational behavior and decisions over emotional ones; have an &ldquo;outward&rdquo; versus Inward orientation to find new customers and seek growth, which requires continual change of products, services and leadership.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Members of the company are conditionally accepted, provided they meet performance expectations, and don&#39;t put up with misbehavior.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>And their business task is to develop skills, foster innovation (change), focus on profitability and seek market penetration.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As you review these conflicting system behaviors, one can quickly realize why many family businesses many times can&rsquo;t survive through several generations.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	One way ESOPs help in Family Business transitions is by helping parents or key shareholders liquefy their primary asset: Company Stock.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>One of the challenges business owners have is &ldquo;how to get money out of the business without losing control?&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>A properly designed ESOP can meet these expectations.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>When an ESOP Trust owns 49.9% of the stock, the other 51% are in &ldquo;control.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Depending on the conditions, the selling shareholder(s) can take a tax benefit, typically called a &ldquo;1042 Rollover&rdquo; to help with the tax burden.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Good ESOP Advisors can complement your team of trusted advisors.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Many times, the founding spouse, passes away and the surviving spouse needs the money, but the kids who work in the business want to retain control, and cannot raise the money to buy &ldquo;Mom or Dad&rdquo; out.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>An ESOP approach can be a blessing to all family members, as it allows for the family&#39;s legacy and control to continue, Mom and Dad get what they need for now, and the company retains family legacy.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	When the parents set up Estate trusts with company stock as the primary asset, in most cases, the beneficiaries, who are typically the children of the founders, want to liquefy their holdings once their parents have passed away, much like the surviving spouse in the prior paragraph.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes""> This puts a huge burden on those who remain in the business. </span>Again, ESOPs can provide a way for the trusts to be liquefied.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	In another scenario, the children are not ready to run the business, and the Family CEO wants to retain legacy, maintain control and provide a future for their young, inexperienced children.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In many cases, the Family CEO has groomed a &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; person who will eventually groom the children and become the CEO until one child emerges as the replacement CEO.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>With the challenge of keeping key people and aligning them to perform well, an ESOP can become a great succession and management retention tool.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	In another scenario, the partners are arguing over the value of the company.&nbsp; Most advisors try to navigate through this conflict by hiring a valuation person without working through the underlying issues that are causing a valuation to be made in the first place.&nbsp; The best ESOP Advisors have the experience and/or advisor relationships to help families work through their issues that will reduce those conflicts and allow for a mutually beneficial solution.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	In most cases, these and other stories have an emotional impact on the family and the business. Employees leave to avoid the fallout, the banks raise concerns and call back debt, and competition starts smelling blood causing market disruption. Buying out family members can be a great solution and help restore and/or maintain family &amp; employee relationships.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There aren&rsquo;t many funding sources or buyers of company stock who will buy a minority interest in a company with the family retaining control.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>ESOPs are a great way to help families navigate through these difficult stories and provide a meaningful way of improving relationships and mending wounds.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Financial or legal advisors who specialize in ESOPs can be an excellent resource for helping family businesses navigate through these tough waters, as they are adept in working with families and their trusted advisors.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>When checking if you have the right ESOP Advisor, the most important question is &ldquo;can my family and key advisors work with the ESOP Advisor?&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The second is: &ldquo;Are they involved in the ESOP communities?&rdquo; as only the best advisors invest in the ESOP community; thus benefitting from interaction and involvement.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Successful business owners do exactly the same thing.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>And finally, &ldquo;do they have the experience with &ldquo;families&rdquo; to not add more disruption to the current state?&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The best advisors work with family systems and know when to bring in the right advisors who can navigate through these issues.</p>

	What&rsquo;s an ESOP?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	There are a number of articles on the legal translation of the answer for &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; and yet they don&rsquo;t cover the other management or advisory views of &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>This article will cover the different perspectives.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>To be clear, ESOPs are for business owners or company shareholders of stock in a successful for profit enterprise, looking for a way to transition their ownership to others.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you personally own stock in a closely-own and successful company, then this brief article is for you!<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you want to learn more about the history of ESOPs, check out this <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/esop-history.html"">ESOP History</a> page.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/accountants"">Accountant</a> or <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/tax-lawyers"">Tax Advisor</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; represents an attractive tax strategy for the business owner, by deferring capital gains on the sale of their stock, or reducing corporate income taxes to help fund the ESOP purchase liability.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As Advisors, their concerns center around tax issues that would need to be surfaced and addressed, before an ESOP Trust is formed.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/erisa-lawyers"">ERISA Attorney</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; means it is a qualified pension plan following the rules of ERISA, both in plan design and governance.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They usually construct documents setting the rules of the trust, much like a trust and estate attorney.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As advisors, they know ESOPs are a great tool for attracting and retaining employees.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They know how do develop qualified compensation plans too.They also know that compliance with ERISA law keeps companies out of trained eye of the DOL or Dept of Labor.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For an <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/esop-lawyers"">ESOP Lawyer</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; is answered as a special qualified pension plan with different rules for handling stock, valuating the assets and preparing plan documents that will not impact the IRS or DOL rules. Generally they are corporate, M&amp;A or ERISA attorneys.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As an advisor, they want to structure the plan and governance documents to ensure the business owner&rsquo;s goals are met, and that the company&rsquo;s plan meets all of the ESOP Standards that most ERISA lawyers rarely develop or manage.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They also help the owner navigate through the due diligence process to avoid surprises, and many times lead the process from start to finish.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/wealth-management"">Wealth Advisor</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; translates to having great way of diversifying a business owner&rsquo;s assets so all of the owner&rsquo;s personal wealth is not tied up in the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As Advisors, they know there are technical aspects for converting company stock to a portfolio of the right stocks for tax and investment strategies.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Our wealth managers know the rules for ESOPs to avoid tax liabilities.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>

	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/valuation"">Valuation Firm</a>, the answer to &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; depends what their role they play in the process: Are they advising on the &ldquo;Buy Side&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sell Side.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>For the buy side, ESOP Valuation firms know ESOPs have rules to follow for arriving at a &ldquo;Fair Market Value.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>ESOP Valuation advisors require special valuation experiences that typically are not found in normal company valuations.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you hire a trustee to value the firm, you will not have a choice of who is selected to value the company; as the buyer is the ESOP Trust/Trustee.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you are testing the waters for becoming an ESOP or sell side, you want a valuation firm that has that same ESOP experience but will not work for the trustee on the valuation.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They work for you to ensure you get the best value for the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They can help in the negotiations when the trustee makes an offer.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The closer the valuation is to the buy side, the better off all parties will be in knowing if an ESOP is right for the business owner.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>But sometimes they disagree greatly.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	&ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; for the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/tpa-third-party-administration"">ESOP Administrator or TPA</a>: means their rules are similar but not the same as a 401k.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>ESOP Administrators know there are very tedious ESOP rules to follow. And they are concerned with repurchase obligations and fulfilling communication requirements. Therefore, it is important to have an administrator that has a large number of ESOPs in their client list not just 401k&rsquo;s.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Hiring a benefits administrator without ESOP experience is dangerous.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/trustees"">Trustee</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>refers to a highly regulated trust, with both the IRS and the DOL rules to follow.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Trustees are considered ERISA experts by the DOL, expecting to have knowledge of ERISA law and are personally liable for various issues that can cause a breach of fiduciary duty.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They are responsible for setting the annual stock price, and must follow best practices on stock value, governance of the company and stock, and ensure they represent the beneficiaries, not other parties. Therefore, many companies hire independent trustees to manage the trust as trustees.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>However, there are many more companies who elect to manage the trust internally, as they are less than 50% owned by the ESOP.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/financing"">investment bankers and other financial advisors</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; can be answered in a number of ways; as ESOPs are one of many ways a company can be sold.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Our investment bankers have years of experience, and will help guide business owners through the many choices they will have.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In some cases, they may not recommend an ESOP but a sale to a strategic buyer for a premium.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Investment bankers and commercial banks have resources to help find the funding sources for the buyout of the selling shareholders.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There are other financial advisors, who specialize in repurchase obligation and ESOP related liability insurance.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/strategic-planning-management-consulting"">Management Consultants</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; refers to a great succession planning tool and a key element to a long range plan.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>When the business owner has developed a deep pool of senior managers, the use of an ESOP can be an effective legacy and compensation strategy.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If the company has not developed a deep pool of successor candidates, the chances of achieving an attractive selling price are lower, as valuation discounts of up to 25% occur.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As Advisors, they approach ESOPs as a great communication activity to improve the company&rsquo;s ownership culture.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They encourage the development of empowered teams and leadership development. They know a big competitive advantage is developing a healthy <a href=""http://esopownershipculture.com/"">ESOP Ownership Culture.</a></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the <a href=""https://www.esopmarketplace.com/advisors/family-business"">Family Business Consultant</a>, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; usually means it is an elegant way of buying out siblings and other family members in a tax advantage way.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>It also allows Families to build out a legacy, reducing family conflicts, and enable their employees to share the success of ownership in the family business.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As Advisors, they use the governance aspects of boards and team development to build out the future generation of owners, both family and employee.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>They know that families and ESOPs can coexist favorably and successfully.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	For the business owner or company shareholder, &ldquo;What is an ESOP?&rdquo; usually means the company will retain management and staff, who helped build the company. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>In many company sale cases, once the company is sold, the new owner makes changes and employees leave. Typical ESOP owners have close relationships with their employees, many treating them like family.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>For minority shareholders, an ESOP is a great way of monetizing their stock with a tax advantage to both themselves and the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In addition, an ESOP also allows the owner to gradually transition out of the business, both operationally and economic ownership without tension and organizational turbulence.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>ESOPs also provide income security for the owner and the employees while allowing the selling owner to retain operating control while the transition unfolds.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Most business owners want to slow down but not leave. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>ESOPs allow for this transition in a smooth and usually uneventful way.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	In the world of corporate tax returns, there are about 6 million tax returns filed each year with about half being C-Corps and the other S-Corps.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There are about 15,000 publicly held companies, which means the vast majority of companies are privately held.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you remove the companies with less than 30 employees, the count is less than 3 million. Of this group, there are about 7,000 companies that file IRS form 5500 that states they have a benefit plan called an &ldquo;ESOP&rdquo; or Employee Stock Ownership Plan.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As such, they are subject to a heightened level of governance rules that are not so much different than a Securities Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) or Office of the Comptroller of Currency (&quot;OCC&quot;) regulated company.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Before we jump into the ESOP governance basics, we need to cover a brief understanding of how ESOPs exist.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In the 1950&rsquo;s, a lawyer named Louis Kelso helped a San Francisco newspaper work through its family ownership issues by applying the rules of a Stock Bonus Plan.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The process was to have the Stock Bonus Plan rules apply to privately held companies in allowing companies to finance the sales of stock without a tax liability.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In 1984, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to add new Section 1042, including a tax deferral benefit to selling shareholders if they sold their shares to an ESOP Trust under certain conditions.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There are detailed rules for forming the trust, and how it benefits employees.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>If you have a 401k or Profit Sharing Plan in your company, you have a similar trust structure as an ESOP.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>For example, all three require a trust be formed, there are assignments for trustee and administration of the trust, it must be funded by the company in some way to get a tax deduction, and there are bonding and fiduciary insurance policies needed.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	A business owner usually decides to sell shares to an ESOP for a number of personal reasons.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>One is the owner&#39;s desire to &ldquo;share the wealth&rdquo; with the employees, as a reward for helping the company grow profitably.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Another is to sustain the company through an ownership transition, which could likely be damaging if the company were sold to an outside party.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Another is the tax benefit of a &ldquo;1042 Rollover&rdquo; whereby those shares are sold to the ESOP Trust, using a fair market valuation, and using the sale proceeds from those shares to purchase Qualified Replacement Property (QRP), thus no tax liability. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Without having a family successor in the business and where the management team cannot afford to buy out the owner, these owners will use an ESOP to develop a qualified buyer when the owner decides to divest his/her shares.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	The governance of an ESOP company may not be any different than any other privately owned company with a minority owned ESOP.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The owners, who are now in majority control, can behave, in most cases, like any other private company with regard to freedom to manage the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>However, with ERISA rules in play, the company&rsquo;s board will need to stay abreast with typical governance best practices.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Duties of care, loyalty and prudence will require the owners to make sure they keep good minutes, avoid conflicts of interest in decisions, and have regularly scheduled meetings set up in advance.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	If you become a director of an ESOP company, there are a number of things you should know that often times trip up ESOP companies.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>

To avoid problems, make sure the board minutes are properly maintained, and the company has both Fiduciary and Directors &amp; Officers Insurance.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>With the company board being the primary fiduciary of the ESOP Trust, you want to be sure the company has a good Trustee and plan Administrator.</p>

	Being on an ESOP Board is not as complex or scary as the above information may create.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In the vast majority of conditions, ESOPs are very successful companies with great management, excellent cash flow, and superior entrepreneur culture.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In our next article, we will cover more advanced topics relating to prohibited transactions, mergers and acquisition issues, and the role of the board in majority owned ESOP companies.</p>

"151","ESOP Governance with Family Involved ","<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Who hasn&rsquo;t heard of a successful, hard-driving, dominant patriarch, who built a family fortune,<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>watch the family (and business) implode due to family conflicts? For ESOP companies with family in the businesses or closely held businesses, setting up trusts for their children and other wealth strategies doesn&#39;t help deal with the business issues.&nbsp; For the CEO of an ESOP company with family in the business, the emotions, not strategy can weigh heavily on the family and business governance structures they are leading and taxing their minds and emotions.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	The story of the Mondavi family illustrates this reality.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>As the story goes, Robert Mondavi, founder of the publicly held Mondavi Winery, invested heavily in family governance structure (e.g., hiring psychiatrists and psychologists) to build a family council as well as develop opportunities to improve relationships among the family members.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Although he took the right steps toward ensuring effective family governance structures, Mondavi&rsquo;s execution failed. Why?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Most historians note the company&rsquo;s board didn&rsquo;t change the way the company was managed. Effective family business and ESOP governance would have avoided many of the pitfalls the Mondavi family faced.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Some of their challenges the company board did not address were: <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>the company was gridlocked by a brother&rsquo;s inability to make decisions, the executives started meeting without the family to get more done, and a market in transition made it hard for the winery to adapt.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>A good board would have discussed these difficult issues and set a plan in place to address them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	With a large portion of the ESOPs having family in the business, many companies don&#39;t deal with issues that impact the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the family business field, there are advisors who believe &ldquo;family issues drive business decisions.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>For the vast majority of my clients caught in family conflict, once the business governance is following best practices, the family conflicts significantly reduce or disappear.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Family issues take a back seat to running the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Having family involvement in the business has its benefits, such as creating a pool of succession candidates, providing a way for family&rsquo;s legacy and traditions to continue, and having family in management and ownership creates a direct management-owner relationship that allows management to take risks and make investments that might otherwise be ignored in a non-family-owned company. Think of the Ford Motor Company during the great recession in 2008. Developing loyal investors, like Ford or the Benjamin-Moore Paints did for more than a century, is a true test of good company governance that can lead to family harmony and continued legacy.&nbsp; ESOPs are designed to create &quot;loyal investors.&quot;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	How could Mondavi&rsquo;s board have improved these conditions?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Robert Mondavi, the founder of the winery, followed his own instincts in running the company and not listened to the board, when what was actually needed was a reshaping of the governance from a single proprietorship to a more engaged and collegial board. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>By listening to the board, Mondavy would have developed a more structured environment and taught accountability and teamwork to the next generation.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Second, with good committee oversight from the board, the founder would not have been forced to choose between his two sons to succeed him.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>There would have been a more collaborative process that would have helped define roles and responsibilities without forcing the founder to make an awful decision.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Had he used his board effectively, Robert Mondavi would have had more enjoyable Thanksgivings and Christmases and a better-functioning company.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	If the board had been measuring its own and the management team&rsquo;s effectiveness using surveys and other tools, it would have uncovered the troubling board behaviors evidenced by the company&rsquo;s lack of adaptability and the executives&rsquo; secret meetings, desperate efforts to keep the company and jobs alive.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The board&rsquo;s measurements would have surely benchmarked how much the market had changed and would have pushed management to be more accountable for improving the company&rsquo;s efforts while the founder was receding from an active role.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	If you are a CEO reading this article and are having problems with succession, invite your independent directors of your board to help you.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Speak candidly with them of your concerns and views.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Allow them to assist you with developing structures and processes that will remove you from selecting the next generation of company leaders.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Push them to get you out of the decision.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Before you do so, let your spouse (if you are married) know that you are doing this to keep family harmony.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>When I am invited in by the widow/ chairwoman to help fix a company&rsquo;s problems, invariably one of her top three goals is family harmony.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>I use board governance to help her, and it works. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Try following your board&rsquo;s suggestions rather than controlling the agenda yourself.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Whether you are a father or a mother, son or daughter, you should push your outside board members to challenge you and the family to improve governance practices.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Once everyone is on the same page with regard to the company&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, the board should then be able to help build accountability to family and non-family members within the company.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The faster you start, the sooner the conflicts will recede.</p>

"150","Maximizing ESOP Valuation Values","<p class=""MsoNormal"">
<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>
 <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>

 </o:OfficeDocumentSettings>
</xml><![endif]-->	To maximize the value of a company, reliable projections from a reliable management team is the most common predictor of success.&nbsp; Valuation firms commonly use the &quot;Discounted Cash Flow&quot; or DCF as a key weight in valuating the company&#39;s stock value. That is why companies dependent on one or two key people get valuation discounts.&nbsp; If your company is lacking in management depth, you need to determine if you need management training or leadership development, or both!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	One of the key elements of an early ESOP transaction is the implementation of succession planning.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Too many ESOP companies have not developed a succession plan to improve their legacy and remain an independent ESOP Company over time. Having over 30 years of Succession experience with over 300 family owned and ESOP companies has led me to define the Succession process in two distinct challenges: Management Training and Leadership Development.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>For founders of an ESOP company, an effective transition can be their most important challenge in their entire career.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Typically, they have never experienced a smooth transition, and they may have control issues that prohibit the natural development of their primary buyers: the employee owners!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>In simple terms, Management Training is the process of educating the pupil with best practices, skills development, and management theory.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Typical activities include communication techniques, time management education, problem solving techniques, goal setting, performance reviews, with classes on change management and team building, just to name a few. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Almost all of these activities are formal training events with some form of presentation, by class, by online/intranet tools, or one-on-one teaching/coaching.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The goals for management training are to improve a person&rsquo;s ability to manage a process, problem, or system, with or without others.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>The result is to improve organizational efficiency by reducing mistakes, improving throughput, and or managing change events.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Leadership Development involves a totally different set of experiences, approaches, and outcomes.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Its focus is to improve organizational effectiveness.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>From advising over 300 CEO&rsquo;s, I found one of the most important aspects of being a successful ESOP CEO, is their capacity to deal with ambiguity, when their decision is &ldquo;betting the business.&rdquo;<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>That means they have, over many years, developed the capacity to make decisions without having all of the facts, can motivate others to perform at a higher level, and have acquired diverse knowledge, wisdom and ethic to discern truth from fiction, and take risks that others would otherwise avoid or prohibit.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Management Training typically involves some form of curriculum and checklist identifying skill sets; that when done properly, reflects the pupil&rsquo;s level of competency, and integrates with performance reviews and incentives.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Leadership development isn&rsquo;t always about performance and success.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>It is about experiential events that put the pupil through a series of experiences that increase their confidence in dealing with changing situations, motivating others in difficult times, and building a portfolio of stories that demonstrate both success and failure over time.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Tears of failure are some of the most important experiences a future CEO can have that will, over time, be the basis of future success.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Concepts of having a vision of the future, and &ldquo;self-efficacy;&rdquo; that is, a person&rsquo;s ability to complete tasks and reach goals, are also involved with this effort.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	Selecting pupils for leadership development can be very difficult.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>How do you measure a person&rsquo;s motivation to learn, have a high need for achievement, have the capacity to remain focused under stress,<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>are open to new experiences, and have the ability to make decisions without all of the facts?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Do they have the courage and conviction to withstand the resistance that occurs with change?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Have they survived a serious failure and turned it into a future success? Do they have the confidence to achieve results without sacrificing their personal ethic?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Where do you get concrete experience that forces the pupil to experience both success and failure?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Does the leadership team encourage and nurture these demanding pupils or victims, depending on your point of view?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	The secret to having a successful leadership development program is the organization&rsquo;s willingness to accept failure as a competitive advantage; when managed properly using teams. It also requires integrating management training with leadership development. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>They can&rsquo;t be separate. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Does a failure end the pupil&rsquo;s career path or enhance it?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>We use team building processes in conjunction with problem solving training to reduce the risks of failure.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Incorporating &ldquo;train the trainer&rdquo; events, and advance management theory to advance a pupil&rsquo;s experience will make a difference.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>We also emphasize personal development with coaching and mentoring processes, when teams affect change.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	If you embark on this effort to develop your CEO&rsquo;s replacement over many years, be mindful it is a change management event.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Every successful ownership transition requires a different set of skills then the ones that got you there.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the skills that helped the current CEO get there, usually are not the same skills that will take the company to the next level of growth and profitability.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>It is this challenge that ESOP companies fail to grow and engage others to perform to a higher level.<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Do you have a succession plan?<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>Do you have an organization that encourages risk, change and organizational effectiveness?</p>

<h1>
	The Corporate Structure</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">ESOP companies who want to convert to subchapter S status must also take care of corporate structural issues on or before the conversion date. For example, if the ESOP was capitalized with more than one class of stock, the second class of stock must be eliminated to elect subchapter S status. It was not uncommon for corporations to use preferred classes of stock in ESOP transactions for the sake of deductible dividends used to fund those transactions. An S corporation must have only one class of stock. In these situations, ESOP fiduciaries will face two fiduciary issues: </span></p>
<p class=""MsoListBullet"" style=""mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"">
	<span style=""font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol;color:#4D4D4D""><span style=""mso-list:Ignore"">&middot;<span style=""font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>First, the issue of whether to convert the preferred shares to common stock under the terms of the agreements in place and the value of the relative classes of stock; and</p>
<p class=""MsoListBullet"" style=""mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1"">
	<span style=""font-family:Symbol;mso-fareast-font-family:Symbol;mso-bidi-font-family:
Symbol;color:#4D4D4D""><span style=""mso-list:Ignore"">&middot;<span style=""font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Second, whether to consent to the subchapter S election. It may be the case that under ERISA, the ESOP fiduciaries should bargain for special consideration to make the conversion most advantageous for the participants, where the difference in value between the classes of preferred and common have not worked themselves out at the date of the conversion.</p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">In short, ESOP fiduciaries should not assume that they should necessarily convert the shares or elect subchapter S status. Financial due diligence is required to support such a decision. This financial due diligence might also include commitments from the corporation on how it is going to manage cash flows and the purported tax advantages of being an S corporation.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">A corporation should also consider the effect of the increase of individual income tax rates on corporate cash flow prior to electing subchapter S status. For example, if a corporation is paying federal income taxes at the rate of 34% and the shareholder&#39;s individual tax rate is 40%, the conversion to subchapter S status would require an additional 6% cash flow cost to the corporation to make distributions to permit shareholders to pay their share of income taxes on S corporation income. If the S corporation is in a high tax rate state like California, there would be a deduction for state taxes paid, but the additional cash flow cost still would be in the 5% to 6% range. This has to be balanced against the cash flow strategies regarding those funds distributed to the ESOP that it does not use to pay taxes.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">On the positive side, conversion to S corporation status will permit those shareholders who do not sell their shares to the ESOP immediately, to start accumulating basis in their shares as S corporation shareholders, due to the tax treatment of earnings each year. This would reduce or contain their future taxable gain if and when they sell their stock, (please see Chart 1). As you can imagine, the most compelling situation for S corporation conversion exists where an ESOP is approaching total ownership of the corporation and a selling shareholder can sell the remainder of his shares, using Code section 1042 to defer the gain, and permit the ESOP to elect subchapter S status once it owns 100% of the company.</span></p>

<h1>
	Subchapter S Details</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">The first subchapter S conversion issue relates to &quot;built in gain&quot; on corporate assets. The appreciation of corporate assets and the depreciation taken on corporate assets is what makes up built in gain. At the date of an S corporation election, the built in gain must be quantified. A corporate level tax is imposed on this built in gain measured at the date of conversion from C to S status, if the gain is &quot;recognized&quot; due to sale of the company&#39;s assets, within ten years of the conversion to subchapter S status. Therefore, corporations considering a complete sale to a third party, or a disposition of certain assets of the corporation which make up the built in gain, would not benefit from the subchapter S election to that extent if the event occurs within ten years of the conversion.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Corporations that earn more than 25% of their gross receipts from &quot;passive investment income&quot; may be subject to an additional S corporation tax after conversion. If an S corporation has earnings and profits from when it was a C corporation, a tax will be imposed on the corporation&#39;s excess net passive investment income. Also, if the 25% limit on net passive investment income continues for three consecutive years, and the corporation still had earnings and profits left over from being a C corporation at the end of those three years, the corporation&#39;s S status will be terminated.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Any corporations that are accounting for inventory on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) method must include in income for its last year as a C corporation on the difference between the inventory on a LIFO basis and on a FIFO (first-in-first-out) basis. The resulting additional tax for this LIFO-FIFO adjustment must be paid in equal installments over a four-year period.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Certain tax attributes from being a C corporation, such as net operating losses, capital loss carryovers, and minimum tax credits are not permitted to be carried over from C corporation status by an S corporation. If a company is just becoming profitable, any net operating loss will be lost if the corporation elects subchapter S status. Also, alternative minimum tax credit carry-forwards, which may be due, for example, from dividends deducted under Code section 404(k) on payments on ESOP shares, would also be lost. Therefore, it is better to use up the operating losses and credit carry-forwards as a C corporation before converting to subchapter S status.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">One attractive aspect of S corporation status is that the S corporation can avoid what is called &quot;accumulated earnings tax&quot; problems because it is not subject to the accumulated earnings tax. Therefore, if the corporation is, for example, a 100% ESOP owned company, it may accumulate cash in the corporation without being subject to this C corporation penalty tax. However, a C corporation that elects S corporation status may wish to distribute any C corporation earnings and profits during the first two-and-one-half months of its initial S corporation tax year to obtain a dividends paid deduction and thus limit or avoid the accumulated earnings tax for its final year as a C corporation.</span></p>

<h1>
	What To Do</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">ESOPs for subchapter S corporations appear to be a compelling alternative, assuming that you are engaged in long-term succession planning or capital planning for an S corporation. However, there is no substitute for &quot;running the numbers.&quot; Due to issues such as reconciling distribution policy, profitability, the nature of the business, and whether it is capital intensive or not, employee benefits practitioners will have to work closely with CPAs in their tax planning for their S corporation clients to make an ESOP work well for any S corporation. Overall, it appears that the S corporation finally has an exit vehicle for succession planning on a tax-favored basis that puts them close to par with C corporations. Although all of the tax incentives available to ESOPs are not available to S corporation ESOPs, those that are not available may be more than offset by the realities of most S corporations and their unique shareholder planning concerns. </span></p>

<p class=""Author"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">by Kevin G. Long, Esq.</span></p>
<p>
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Most business owners assume that when they are ready to retire/sell/move on, that all-cash buyers or buyers that let them just walk away will be there. In the real world, however, there are not many buyers that will meet a seller&#39;s initial expectations, even if the owner looks for one. Fortunately, like the prince, if the business owner is properly advised and searches far and wide, he may just find the perfect buyer &mdash; in the form of an ESOP. This may bring him, his employees and the company magnificent tax advantages and a resolution of the selling shareholder&#39;s succession problem.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"" style=""line-height:115%"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">There is a catch. The business owner has to look hard and be dedicated to the search for a business-succession solution. Finding Cinderella may require trying a &quot;glass slipper&quot; on a number of alternatives. Most will not fit. Hopefully, one will. It is this author&#39;s opinion that in many circumstances the business planning slipper will fit the ESOP, and everyone can live happily ever after, tax benefits and all. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"" style=""line-height:115%"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Let&#39;s take a look at some of the obstacles the business owner has to overcome to find the right solution or determine if an ESOP will be a part of his Cinderella fairy tale. </span></p>
<h1>
	Assemble And Review The Alternatives</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">As the story goes, the prince/owner must throw a &quot;ball&quot; and invite all the fair maidens/business-planning alternatives and look them over. They may include family limited partnerships, sales to third parties, a non-ESOP sale to management, or simply the liquidation of the company. The business owner should be advised of the tax, control and estate planning concerns and economics of each alternative for himself and his family and how they affect the company and its employees. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">As in the fairy tale, it is often pure chance or serendipity that the ESOP even makes it to the ball. In most situations, the business-planning advisers are only somewhat familiar (if not entirely unfamiliar) with ESOPs as an alternative. For many business owners, a trusted business adviser may turn out to be the &quot;fairy godmother&quot; that sees to it that the ESOP is presented for what it truly is. Alternatively, the close adviser may be a &quot;jealous stepsister&quot; who keeps the prince from meeting his Cinderella. After all, an ESOP is a highly complex, yet extraordinarily versatile, planning vehicle. Many business advisers will not consider or assist the owner in evaluating an ESOP because it seems to compete with other traditional estate- or business-planning objectives that they are more comfortable and familiar with. It is important when assembling all the alternatives to ensure that the ESOP is included and seen for what it is and what it can do. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">It is, therefore, the job of business advisers to any company or the shareholder planning a long-term business or succession strategy to ensure that an ESOP is considered. Furthermore, if the business owner&#39;s advisers do not know how to dress up and present an ESOP to their client, then perhaps they should contact an Employee Retirement Income Security Act fairy godmother, who may be a specialized ERISA attorney or specialized ESOP consulting firm, to present the alternative in all its tax-advantaged glory. The business owner&#39;s regular advisers should not fear the inclusion of the ESOP in the planning process. After all, all they are concerned with is making sure that the prince/owner is happy.</span></p>
<h1>
	How To Spot The ESOP At The Ball</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">For the ESOP to stand out in the parade of business-planning options, it is important to understand how the ESOP can fit in. An ESOP can take many forms and be used in many ways. Let&#39;s take a look at some of the ways an ESOP can be a part of the business and succession-planning process. It can:</span></p>

<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Often, more than one of these ESOP advantages can apply to a business owner&#39;s needs. For example, a sale of shares to an ESOP can provide the selling shareholder with capital gains deferral, finance the purchase with pre-tax dollars, and permit the company to borrow in order to finance the purchase with a loan at an interest rate lower than they could have normally obtained.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">For a more detailed look at the capital gains deferral mechanism and the corresponding reasons employees would be interested in using an ESOP, see the article, <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">It&#39;s No Fairy Tale: ESOPs Benefit Both Buyers And Sellers</i>.</span></p>
<h1>
	Does The Slipper Fit?</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">So, the business owner has caught a glimpse of the fair ESOP beauty at the ball and learns that she comes with magnificent tax advantages. Is an ESOP really right for the situation? Unfortunately, there is no way for the shareholder to get around trying the business-planning slipper on several alternatives on a one-on-one basis before deciding what fits. After the initial glimpse, the shareholder needs to carefully evaluate the suitability of the business planning alternatives.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">There are some basic questions you can ask about the company and the shareholder owners to determine whether an ESOP is worth considering:</span></p>

<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">In addition to the tax incentives discussed in <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:normal"">It&#39;s No Fairy Tale: ESOPs Benefit Both Buyers And Sellers</i>, an owner of a business has to dwell, as mentioned above, on the reality that there are not that many buyers available to acquire his company. The all-cash buyer is a classic myth of the closely held corporation. More often than not, sale to a third party involves a certain amount of cash up-front, with the remainder of it financed over a period of time. It is sometimes possible for a buyer to obtain cash financing through a bank or other lender, but typically this is not for 100 percent of the purchase price. Sometimes, alternative sale approaches are &quot;earn-outs&quot; or other payments depending upon future profitability of the company that is being sold. Finally, there is also the possibility that a merger could occur with a publicly traded corporation in which the owner of the closely held company receives shares from the publicly held company. In that situation, the seller does not receive cash, but in theory the shares he receives in payment are more liquid and more easily disposed of in the market, although this is often times subject to substantial restrictions after the sale.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">So what does a selling shareholder do? It is important to get objective and expert information and a comparison of the sale alternatives to determine whether the trade-off in the last question above, can inspire him to consider an ESOP. After all, that is precisely what the Congress intended when they passed all of the tax incentives for ESOPs. They wanted them to become attractive enough for the shareholder owners to consider their employees as not just an attractive alternative, but arguably one of the best alternatives available for selling a closely held business. </span></p>
<h1>
	Important ESOP Suitability Questions</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">Whether an ESOP is suitable for the owner and the company also depends upon a number of factors. While the tax advantages apply to nearly all (assuming a company is profitable, is paying taxes, and can use the tax benefits), other less quantifiable issues have to be weighed. For example, the following should be considered:</span></p>

<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">There may be a few answers to these questions that indicate an ESOP may not be suitable for a company. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>However, there are few obstacles that may be identified in this list that are intrinsic to ESOPs. That is, most of the reasons an ESOP is not suitable are company-specific, owner-specific, or economic and financial. In most situations, it is not the ESOP itself that is unsuitable for a given company.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">In the course of analyzing the trade-offs and advantages of an ESOP, certain common myths and misconceptions will rise to the surface. That is why we have written <i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"">Common Misconceptions About ESOPs</i>. Take a look at some of the points we raise. Do any of these sound familiar to you if you are a business adviser or business owner? Have you heard these before? While complete and exhaustive answers to those misconceptions are beyond the scope of this issue, hopefully we have begun to address them.</span></p>
<h1>
	What To Do?</h1>
<p class=""MsoBodyText"">
	<span lang=""X-NONE"">If you are a company owner (a real prince) or are a business adviser to the kingdom, it is important to be sure that all business planning alternatives are invited to the ball. Do not make the mistake of making the ESOP stay at home. It may turn out to be exactly what the kingdom needs. Before you choose an ESOP, though, be sure to have a qualified ERISA attorney or consultant evaluate all the positives and negatives that will determine whether an ESOP can bring a happily-ever-after conclusion to your business planning needs.</span></p>

"144","ESOP's Myths and the Benefits of Employee Stock Ownership Plans","<p>
	<em>The original article appeared in EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN REVIEW.</em></p>
<p>
	Owners of closely held businesses under-utilize Employee Stock Ownership Plans (&quot;ESOPs&quot;) as an ideal vehicle for achieving key business and tax deferral goals. Many of these owners have no exit strategy when they are ready for retirement. An ESOP will provide a market for the business owner&#39;s stock and allow him or her to achieve liquidity while still controlling the business. In addition, the business owner will enjoy substantial tax benefits under section 1042 of the Internal Revenue Code (&quot;Code&quot;) if he or she sells at least 30% of his or her shares to an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	Despite these advantages, many closely held business owners fail to consider the ESOP alternative - and fail to do so for the wrong reasons. Most of the reasons used to reject an ESOP are simply not valid. In this article, I will review a few of the reasons commonly used to reject an ESOP and explain why, for the vast majority of business owners, these reasons amount to nothing more than &quot;myths&quot; about ESOPs and ESOP transactions and, therefore, why business owners should give careful consideration to an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	Business owners reject ESOPs primarily for the following reasons:</p>
<ol style=""list-style:initial;"">
	<li>
		the owner is looking for a strategic buyer who will pay a premium for the business;</li>
	<li>
		the owner does not want to give his or her employees control of the business and/or provide too much information to the employees about the business;</li>
	<li>
		the employees do not want to buy the business; and</li>
	<li>
		an ESOP transaction is too complex.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	After carefully reviewing all the alternatives, however, it is abundantly clear that the sale of shares to an ESOP is highly advantageous to the closely held business owner and in many cases represents the best alternative for achieving liquidity from his or her business.</p>
<p>
	At some point in their careers, most closely held business owners decide that they want to divest their holdings and liquidate some of their investment in the business. While seeking liquidity, most business owners are not quite ready to give up control of the business. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find a buyer who is willing to purchase a minority share in a closely held business, even a highly profitable one. The most likely buyers - key employees of the business - rarely have the financial resources to acquire a significant portion of the company and they want to be given the stock as a reward for past efforts (as opposed to purchasing such shares).</p>
<p>
	Some business owners believe that a sale of shares to a third-party investor presents a viable alternative. However, in the author&#39;s experience, a third party sale rarely is a good option because the third party rarely is willing to pay what the company is worth. In those rare cases in which a strategic buyer is willing to pay a premium for a closely held business, the owner is usually willing to give up his or her control. In other rare instances, the business is large enough and profitable enough to raise capital through public offering or private placement. More frequently, a potential buyer will want to purchase a controlling interest in the business at far below its value and will insist upon some degree of management control.</p>
<p>
	In other cases, the owner would like to leave the business to his or her children. However, it is uncommon for children to have an interest in continuing a family business. Even when such an interest exists, in most cases, only one of an individual&#39;s children possesses that interest and the owner needs a mechanism to convert the interests of the other children into cash.</p>
<p>
	When one also considers the tax advantages of ESOPs, it&#39;s surprising that the number of ESOPs formed in this country is relatively small. In the author&#39;s view, the reason for this is that the disadvantages of ESOPs are misunderstood and overblown.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Myth #1: The owner is looking for a &quot;strategic&quot; or other third-party buyer for the business. </strong></p>
<p>
	I hear this refrain frequently from closely held business owners. The truth is that few closely held business owners have a realistic assessment of the true fair market value of their business. Many wrongly assume that a strategic buyer is always waiting in the wings with a generous cash offer. In the author&#39;s experience, these optimistic assessments rarely prove to be true. Strategic buyers do exist, but are very rare and are looking for targets in &quot;hot&quot; industries of the moment. The problem for closely held business owners is that they can never rely on the availability of strategic offers because the investment community is notoriously fickle. Today&#39;s hot industry may be tomorrow&#39;s &quot;has been&quot;.</p>
<p>
	The vast majority of closely held business owners stand no possibility of realizing a premium from a strategic buyer. For these owners, finding a third party willing to buy their business at any price is a challenge, particularly if the success of the business is largely dependent upon the personal efforts of one or two owners. In the event one of these owners is too old or ill to continue operating the business, it will lose most of its value. In most cases, the problem is that the owner does even begin to search for a buyer until he or she is unable or unwilling to continue operating the business. A significant number of closely held business owners simply abandon their businesses without receiving any significant compensation.</p>
<p>
	An ESOP is a far more advantageous alternative. By selling a minority interest to the ESOP, the business owner can &quot;cash out&quot; part of his equity at a fair price and keep control of the business. Moreover, in a properly structured transaction, the owner can sell his minority interest without taking a &quot;minority interest discount&quot; and do so without paying any federal income tax on the proceeds of the sale.</p>
<p>
	Consider this example.</p>
<p>
	John, age 55, owns 100% of ABC Corp., a closely held business worth $10,000,000. He decides to sell 30% of ABC to an ESOP. To finance the transaction, the ESOP borrows $3,000,000 from a bank, for which ABC guarantees repayment. John sells 30% of ABC&#39;s stock to the ESOP for $3 million in cash. Provided that John invests the $3 million in stocks or bonds of any domestic corporation (known as Qualified Replacement Property or QRP), he pays no tax on the gain he realized on the sale. Assuming a 25% combined capital gains tax rate, John defers payment of $750,000 in tax. By holding the QRP for the rest of his life, John can <em>permanently</em> avoid payment of tax on the gain (as his heirs receive a step-up in his tax basis upon his death).</p>
<p>
	Over the next several years, the ESOP will repay the bank loan from annual contributions that ABC makes to the ESOP. Because these company contributions are fully deductible, for federal income tax purposes, the government, in effect, pays almost 40% of the cost of repaying both the principal and interest on the loan.</p>
<p>
	Depending upon the economics, John could have sold more than 30% of his shares to an ESOP. In any event, once the ESOP loan has been repaid, or even as the loan is being repaid, John is free to sell additional shares to the Plan.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Myth #2: The owner does not want to give employees control over the business. </strong></p>
<p>
	Many business owners wrongly assume that they will lose control over their business the moment that they sell a few shares of stock to an ESOP. In reality, quite the opposite is true. In addition, many closely held business owners do not realize that sale of stock to an ESOP does <em>not</em> mean sale of their stock to the employees themselves.</p>
<p>
	In a typical ESOP transaction, only 30% of the company&#39;s outstanding shares are sold to the ESOP. While Section 409(e)(3) of the Code requires a vote with respect to major corporate transactions (such as a merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, liquidation, dissolution, or sale of substantially all of the company&#39;s assets) to be &quot;passed through&quot; to ESOP participants, the business owner will still control 70% of the outstanding shares and, in most states, will retain super majority status. Even in these transactions, employees do not vote all of the stock in the ESOP but only the shares allocated to their accounts. The remaining portion, i.e. the amount held as security for the unpaid loan, is voted by the trustee of the ESOP. Furthermore, transactions that implicate Code Section 409(e)(3) are rare occurrences for most closely held businesses. The day-to-day operation of a closely-business is not affected by the existence of an ESOP as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>
	While it is prudent (and generally recommended) that the company appoint an independent trustee to protect the interests of the ESOP and its participants with respect to a transaction to purchase company stock, many employers replace the trustee with a corporate officer or shareholder after the completion of the transaction. To be sure, the officer has a fiduciary obligation under the federal pension law known as ERISA to act &quot;solely in the interest of the plan and its participants.&quot; However, in most cases, the interests of the ESOP and the company will not diverge. In general, the ESOP holds only the rights of a shareholder, which generally do not include the right to actively participate in the operation or management of the business. In short, the ability of the owner of a closely held business to manage the day-to-day operation of the business will not be affected by the existence of an ESOP serving as a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>
	The rights of the employees themselves to participate in the management of the sponsoring employer are even more limited. As noted above, employees have no right to vote the shares held by the ESOP on their behalf unless the shares have been allocated to their accounts (which occurs as the loan is repaid) and even then can vote only on major corporate transactions. Similarly, as it pertains to the ESOP, it is the trustee of the ESOP, not the employees of the business themselves, who generally has access to financial information concerning the business. Such information would need to be provided to the employees only in the case of a major corporate transaction subject to Section 409(e)(3) of the Code.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Myth #3: The employees do not want to buy the business. </strong></p>
<p>
	This is another common refrain and is based upon a mistaken assumption that employees should be involved in the decision making process of establishing an ESOP. From a pure legal perspective, employees have no role in the decision making process &ndash; the decision to establish an ESOP is one that is reserved exclusively to management. More importantly, the reason to establish an ESOP is because the owner wants to sell the business, not because the employees want to buy the business. The owner of a business would rarely hesitate to sell his or her business to an unrelated third party because of perceived employee objections.</p>
<p>
	Furthermore, the sale to the ESOP is a gradual process. Typically, the business owner sells only 30% of the business in the first transaction. The term of the loan to the ESOP generally lasts from five to seven years. Over that period of time, the owner continues to retain full management control of the company and its affairs. In most cases, the ESOP transaction is a successful one and the loan is fully repaid. When the loan is fully repaid, the owner can consider a second sale of stock which involves another five to seven year loan. Because the process is gradual, many employees who initially had no interest in buying the business when the ESOP was established will begin to develop the skills and desire to become involved in management. In the alternative, the owner will have time to attract outside talent capable of assuming management control of the company.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Myth #4: ESOPs are too complex. </strong></p>
<p>
	This is probably the most commonly misunderstood aspect of ESOP transactions. Many prospective ESOP sponsors are put off by explanations of fiduciary duty and independent trustees. While it is true that there are many complex rules that govern what can and cannot be done in an ESOP transaction, a sale of the stock of an employer to an ESOP is not materially more complex than selling the stock to a sophisticated third party. Knowledgeable professionals can guide even the least sophisticated employer through the transaction.</p>
<p>
	It is also true that the subsequent administration of an ESOP is more complex than the administration of a 401(k) or profit sharing plan. The sponsoring employer must make a contribution sufficient so that the ESOP is able to pay both interest and principal on the loan and shares representing the principal repaid must be released from escrow. However, the administration of an ESOP can be separated into two distinct elements &ndash; allocating shares and routine administration. Once the shares that are to be released from escrow are determined, the allocation of such shares to participant accounts is very similar to the process for profit sharing or other defined contribution plans. Routine administration involves such tasks as enrolling new employees and processing distributions. Again, there are many knowledgeable professionals to walk the ESOP sponsor through the administrative process.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, it is undisputed that there are costs associated with an ESOP transaction and ongoing administration of an ESOP. However, the cost of selling an ESOP is generally not much greater than the cost of selling a closely held business to any sophisticated buyer. The cost of ESOP administration is somewhat higher than the cost of administering a comparable profit sharing or 401(k) plan. However, these additional costs are far outweighed by the tax benefits available to ESOP sponsors and selling shareholders.</p>
<p>
	In some cases, the notion that ESOPs are overly complex is exacerbated by some of the employer&#39;s professionals, including accountants and general practice attorneys. Undoubtedly, some of specialized rules that one must follow in order to obtain favorable tax treatment for an ESOP sale may seem daunting to those professionals who are unfamiliar with ESOP transactions. However, these rules are mechanical and are relatively simple to understand and follow if one is willing to take the time to learn them.</p>
<p>
	Many of the professionals who are familiar with ESOPs recognize that educating the business owner&#39;s trusted professionals is an essential first step in the process of implementing an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
	In many cases, an ESOP is the most attractive method for an individual to realize value from a closely-held business and to diversify his or her assets. It is in the interest of any business owner to seriously consider an ESOP as an alternative to any of the other available strategies.</p>

"143","ESOPs as a Business Succession Tool For Small or Mid-Sized Construction/Engineering Firms","<p>
	Many engineering and construction firm owners will be retiring in large numbers in the coming years. Those whose children don&rsquo;t want the family business face a dilemma. With more &ldquo;baby-boomer&rdquo; sellers than buyers, buyers are likely to be highly selective and very parsimonious.</p>
<p>
	<span style=""color:#4bacc6;"">Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)</span> are a viable business succession alternative. In concept, sale to an ESOP is simple. Instead of selling to a third party, the owner sells to a trust established and operated by the firm for the benefit of its employees. To finance the purchase, the ESOP borrows from a bank or the business owner himself. The shares of the business are collateral for the loan. As the business operates, it makes contributions to the ESOP until the loan is repaid. Otherwise, the ESOP operates like a 401(k) or profit sharing plan, except that it invests in employer stock.</p>
<p>
	While ESOPs cover all full-time, non-union employees, they <em>never</em> directly own company shares, have access to the company&rsquo;s finances or have a say in day-to-day decisions. Nevertheless, ESOPs are powerful productivity incentives, as employees view themselves as part owners.</p>
<p>
	There are <em>substantial tax incentives </em>to owners who sell to ESOPs and companies that operate as ESOPs. Usually, the owner can avoid payment of <span style=""color:#4bacc6;"">capital gains tax</span> otherwise payable upon the sale of the business. In addition, both principal and interest on the loan to purchase the company are repaid with <em>pre-tax dollars. </em>More importantly, once the ESOP acquires 100 percent of the firm, it can elect Subchapter S status, allowing it to pass through profits to its tax-exempt ESOP shareholder and <em>operate as <u>a tax-free company</u></em>.</p>
<p>
	Another more practical advantage is that unlike a third-party buyer, an ESOP will rarely back out at the eleventh hour. Sale to an ESOP also requires much less disruption of business and the owner can sell shares gradually, relinquishing control at a time of his or her choosing. Third parties usually demand complete control from day one. Additionally, any additional cost of structuring a sale to an ESOP is easily outstripped by the tax savings.</p>
<p>
	ESOPs are also useful if only some of the owner&rsquo;s children want to participate in the business. Giving stock to children who don&rsquo;t participate in the business is likely to cause strife among siblings. The ESOP can purchase the stock of non-participating children for cash.</p>
<p>
	When to consider an ESOP:</p>
<ul style=""list-style: initial"">
	<li>
		Firm is worth $2 million, or with profits of $400,000 a year;</li>
	<li>
		Firm has a recent history of profitability and/or strong prospects of future profitability;</li>
	<li>
		There are two to three individuals capable of assuming a lead management role in the next five years;</li>
	<li>
		Firm is a <span style=""color:#4bacc6;"">corporation</span> or capable of being converted into one.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Other helpful, but not essential, factors:</p>
<ul style=""list-style: initial"">
	<li>
		Current owners want to gradually transition out;</li>
	<li>
		Owners want to reward employees for their service;</li>
	<li>
		Employees are likely to be incentivized by ownership in the company.</li>
</ul>

"142","ESOPs - The Ideal Vehicle for Buying Out a Minority Shareholder","<p>
	Traditionally, employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are used as a vehicle to facilitate the retirement of the sole (or majority) shareholder of a closely held corporation and to finance business acquisitions. However, ESOPs are sometimes the perfect (and often overlooked) financing vehicle for many other corporate transactions. For example, when structured properly, ESOPs can be the ideal vehicle to purchase the interest of a minority shareholder/investor.</p>
<p>
	ESOPs as a financing tool work particularly well if the company is a Subchapter C corporation, as the selling shareholder can take advantage of the tax deferral for ESOP rollovers under the Internal Revenue Code. In those cases, there are two principle reasons for the ESOP&#39;s advantage over a simple buyout: (1) <strong>both </strong>principal and interest are fully deductable to the corporation; and (2) the selling shareholders pay <strong>zero </strong>tax on their gain if they engage in an ESOP rollover transaction. In such situations, there can be a 50 percent savings realized in the total cost of the transaction. These savings are best illustrated by the example set forth below.</p>
<p>
	Consider the following differences between a majority shareholder&#39;s direct purchase of minority held corporation shares and his/her same purchase of shares through an ESOP, where the objective is to provide the selling shareholder with $10 million after taxes. In both cases, the corporation is the ultimate source of the funds. In the first instance, the investor/sellers pay no capital gains tax in a properly structured ESOP transaction. Assuming a combined 20 percent state and federal capital gains rate, in a private transaction, the selling shareholder/investor would need to receive $12.5 million to put him or her in the same after-tax financial position.</p>
<p>
	Further, assume that both the shareholder/purchaser and the ESOP will finance the transaction through an outside lender over a five-year period. Whereas the ESOP would need to repay $12 million (arbitrarily assuming $10 million principal and $2 million interest), the majority shareholder would repay $15 million ($12.5 million principal and $2.5 million interest) using the same assumptions. In the ESOP transaction, the net cost of the repayment to the sponsoring corporation is approximately $7.2 million over five years (assuming a 40 percent marginal corporate tax rate). By comparison, in a private sale, the corporation would have to pay a purchasing majority shareholder almost $21 million over five years in order to provide sufficient after-tax funds for him/her to repay the loan&#39;s $12.5 million principal, plus $2.5 million to pay the loan&#39;s interest (which is deductible and need not be &quot;grossed up&quot;). Thus, to equal the corporation&#39;s expenses under an ESOP equity sale, it would have to provide the purchasing majority shareholder approximately $23.5 million at an after-tax cost of almost $14.1 million - almost twice as much as would be required using an ESOP transaction! The ability to achieve such extraordinary savings warrants commensurate efforts to structure the ESOP transaction as to allow it and its shareholders the advantages of these tax savings.</p>

<p>
	In order to realize the full benefits of the ESOP rollover, the selling shareholder must invest in &quot;qualified replacement property&quot; and sell at least 30 percent of the company to the ESOP while meeting several other technical requirements.</p>
<p>
	However, in most cases, the ESOP is economically superior to other financing arrangements, leaving these requirements palatable to the selling shareholder.</p>
<p>
	Undoubtedly, not every corporation or transaction is suited to be structured as an ESOP transaction. Generally, the ideal private company candidate for an ESOP will meet most of the following criteria: (1) strong cash flow; (2) history of increasing sales and profits; (3) consistently been in a high federal income tax bracket; and (4) substantial stockholder equity. The other attribute - that the company have strong management - is always satisfied in the case of a minority buyout.</p>
<p>
	Whether an ESOP is ultimately the right tool for a transaction largely depends on the specifics of the company and the contemplated transaction. However, the ESOP alternative always merits serious consideration based on the potential cost savings and tax advantages it presents.</p>

"135","ESOPs - Keeping Family Businesses in the ""Family""","<p>
	Family-owned businesses, a key pillar in the American economy, make up a significant number of the privately held companies across our country. Although these companies cut across all industries and range in size from small to large, they all share common challenges. The most daunting of these challenges is how to manage the transition of the business from generation to generation. Keeping the core family values balanced with an ever-changing market place and often diverging goals amongst the family members is a challenge that many family businesses don&rsquo;t survive. One intriguing solution to this challenge for many family-owned businesses is to bring the employees into the shareholder group through the sale of stock to an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).</p>
<p>
	While creating a liquidity strategy for owners of privately held businesses, the sale to an ESOP also provides desirable tax advantages to the owners who sell to an ESOP and to the companies that have an ESOP as a shareholder. A sale to an ESOP appeals to many family-owned businesses because of its flexibility, and ability to provide different options for different family (shareholder) groups. This can be of particular importance as family-owned businesses transition into second, third and fourth generations. For family members who want to continue to own and run the business, the ESOP can provide significant tax advantages and support powerful gifting strategies to preserve the family ownership while minimizing personal, corporate and estate taxes. For family members who are not actively engaged in the business, the ESOP can provide a liquidity option or an income stream that supports life outside of the family business. Often times, divergent interests or goals cause family businesses to transition away from the family, but the ESOP can provide appealing solutions to preserve family ownership and control.</p>

	As family businesses grow, ever more positions within the company are assumed by non-family members. However, as these companies evolve, these same employees become members of the family and help perpetuate the culture and values of the original family business. An ESOP trust allows these members of the extended family (employees) to participate in ownership without ceding control to an outside party.</p>
<p>
	Key Characteristics of ESOPs Make this Possible:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		An ESOP is comfortable owning a minority stake in the company</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP Trust holds the stock on behalf of the employees; the employees don&rsquo;t control the company</li>
	<li>
		The Board of Directors continue to control the business with senior management remaining in place</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP Trust is comfortable with long-term holding periods, meaning there is no time limit to its ownership and it could own the company into perpetuity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Selling the family-owned business to the employees through an ESOP is often a natural and comfortable transition for family-owned businesses, and allows the culture of the company to remain intact while giving the family ultimate flexibility to meet the needs of all family members.</p>

"133","Tax Rates, Strategic Premiums, and the Cost-Benefit of Selling to an ESOP","<p>
	A question we are often asked by business owners in the exit planning process is similar to the following: </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Would it be more financially beneficial for me to sell my shares to a strategic buyer or to sell my shares to an employee stock ownership plan and elect tax deferral under Section 1042?&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	Since the reduction of the capital gains taxes in the late 1990s, the answer to the question for most business owners is that they would realize more after-tax cash proceeds if they sold their shares to a strategic buyer. However, with the recent increase in the long-term capital gain tax rate and the additional Medicare surcharge, the answer to the above question has changed dramatically. </p>
<p>
	The decision regarding which one is more financially beneficial depends on a number of factors including the following:...</p>

"132","Exit Planning and Valuation","<p>
	Eventually, every business owner will exit his or her business &ndash; whether voluntarily or otherwise. At that time, every owner wants to accomplish certain personal, business, financial, and estate planning goals. Most fail to do so. According to a number of surveys, efforts by business owners to exit their businesses have been, on average, less than satisfying. The majority of business owners regret the decision to sell their company because the sale did not accomplish their personal or business objectives. Most of these business owners cite the lack of knowledge or understanding of the available exit strategies. </p>
<p>
	Exit planning is the deliberate, adaptable, and customized process for assisting business owners with a successful strategy to exit from their company. It is designed to provide the owner with information regarding available exit strategies so that he or she can make an informed decision. A well-designed and implemented exit plan will help owners achieve the personal, business, and financial legacies they want to achieve upon their eventual exit from their business. </p>

"128","Why Choose an ESOP?","<p>
	<strong>Employee Stock Ownership Plans give your employees a slice of the ownership pie.<br />
	</strong></p>
<p>
	When it comes to deciding upon an exit strategy, owners of closely held businesses have a lot to think about. Faced with the frightening prospect of turning over the business they have worked so hard to build to new ownership, they might worry about what will happen to the company &ndash; and their employees &ndash; once they&rsquo;re gone. Selling the business to a third party isn&rsquo;t always a welcome or viable option. But if there isn&rsquo;t a qualified management team or successor in mind, what&rsquo;s a business owner to do?</p>
<p>
	Fortunately, there is an alternative that can help ensure the continuation of the business while providing significant financial rewards for both the owner and the employees: selling the business to employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).</p>
<p>
	An ESOP is a trust set up by a corporation to allot some of its stock to its employees over time. It&rsquo;s similar in many ways to a profit&#8208;sharing plan. Shares are allocated to individual employee accounts based on their compensation levels as well as how long they have worked for the company &ndash; as employees accumulate seniority, they become increasingly vested in the account.</p>
<p>
	ESOPs can be used for many purposes, including:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		As part of an ownership succession strategy</li>
	<li>
		As a pure employee benefit plan</li>
	<li>
		As a component of a complete leveraged buyout</li>
	<li>
		To create a market for inside or outside shareholders</li>
	<li>
		To enable shareholders with management responsibilities to gradually ease out of the business</li>
	<li>
		To finance corporate acquisitions</li>
	<li>
		To enhance employee performance and morale</li>
</ol>
<p>
	This variability, plus an attractive slate of tax benefits, makes an ESOP a compelling choice in a number of succession planning and corporate finance situations. Further, ESOPs can help business owners gradually begin the process of converting their closely held ownership over to liquid, diversified capital &ndash; without a tax bite.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;One of the greatest advantages of ESOPs is they are scalable over time,&rdquo; said Robert Gross, Senior Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;ESOPs start the succession planning process while creating opportunities for various end results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	An ESOP can also help ensure the company will retain the owner&rsquo;s original corporate vision by helping to retain key managers. In addition, because employees own a portion of the company, they will have stronger ties to it and will be more likely to work hard to ensure its success. Other benefits include:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Companies can fund ESOPs with pre&#8208;tax dollars</li>
	<li>
		The owner may sell to the ESOP in stages, gradually relinquishing control of the company</li>
	<li>
		ESOPs can be used to raise capital in order to finance acquisitions or refinance debt</li>
	<li>
		ESOPs can infuse working cash flow into the corporation</li>
	<li>
		ESOPs can be used to match employee contributions to a 401(k) plan, significantly reducing the cost of employee benefits</li>
</ol>
<p>
	According to the National Center for Employee Ownership, there are more than 11,000 companies with ESOPs, ranging from small businesses operating in niche markets to industry giants like McDonald&rsquo;s Corporation and Procter &amp; Gamble. More than eight million employees in the U.S. today own stock in their companies through ESOPs. Yet, this represents only seven percent of the non&#8208;governmental U.S. workforce. Considering the breadth of benefits, why aren&rsquo;t ESOPs more popular? </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A lot of business owners are intimidated by ESOPs, thinking they are too complex,&rdquo; said Kenneth Serwinski, Senior Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;They believe it&rsquo;s easier to just sell the company.&rdquo; While ESOPs certainly present unique challenges, they&rsquo;re actually less complicated than a lot of people might think. In many cases, the tax and financial advantages far outweigh the effort of implementation. A trusted financial advisory firm like Prairie Capital Advisors can help you determine if an ESOP is right for you and then help you put the plan in place. Before long, you&rsquo;ll be on your way to a happy retirement and your employees will help you celebrate by enjoying a slice of the ownership pie.</p>

"127","What is Your Ownership Transition Timeline?","<p>
	You&rsquo;ve owned your business for years. You&rsquo;ve grown it, nurtured it and now the time might be approaching for you to move on. After so many years even if the thought of transitioning your business hasn&rsquo;t entered your mind, it is time to start planning for ownership transition. As a business owner, the earlier you determine your unique ownership transition timeline, the more options there are available to you. Planning allows you to have control over the process, letting you better plan for both your personal future and that of your business. </p>
<p>
	The bottom line is that you need a plan and you should start the timeline development process now. </p>
<p>
	Closely held business owners should begin the planning process by determining their ideal ownership transition timelines. They should assess their desired degree of ownership of their companies over the periods of the next three, five and 10 years. The owners should also determine to what extent they want to remain involved with the management of their companies during and following these timeframes. </p>
<p>
	Some owners might want to exit their companies in less than a year, while others might plan to transition their businesses over a five year timeline. The possibilities are as varied as the companies themselves, and unique to each owner and situation. Whatever the chosen timeline, companies are well advised to seek counsel from experienced ownership transition planning specialists such as Prairie Capital Advisors, Inc. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Business owners come to us because they want to know their options and then determine the best course of action for their particular situation,&rdquo; said Kenneth Serwinski, Senior Managing Director for Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;We start by helping them develop their timelines &ndash; where do they want to be in five years? Ten years? On the golf course or in the boardroom? Regardless, the sooner the planning process starts, the more alternatives we can present to each owner.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	Closely held business owners who want to completely exit their businesses quickly might have fewer alternatives available to them. For owners who choose to exit their businesses in one year or less, often the best alternative is a sale to an external party. Ownership transition planning specialists can work with closely held business owners to find interested buyers, as well as provide valuation services to best position the company for sale. </p>
<p>
	For such abbreviated ownership transition timelines, recently there has been a trend to accomplish 100% Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) transactions, but owners might be constrained by the capital required to do so. If a business owner opts to exit through an ESOP in a shortened timeframe, then the business owner&rsquo;s support is especially critical in order to consummate the transaction. Support from the business owner will come in the form of either a seller note or guarantees. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If closely held business owners plan to exit their company in five or 10 years, for example,&rdquo; explained Serwinski, &ldquo;They can use an ESOP alternative and receive a percentage of their company&rsquo;s value now and the remaining value five years down the road as they transition to a part&#8208;time basis. Furthermore, an internal recapitalization can be consummated in a short timeframe due to the fact that it is an internal negotiation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	When closely held businesses transition via an ESOP, the owners often remain with the business for some time to train the new management to eventually run the business, as well as to assist in the development of the company&rsquo;s business strategy. A management buyout is another form of internal recapitalization that doesn&rsquo;t require closely held business owners to completely relinquish control of the company. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;If a business owner takes the time to plan ahead and weigh the different ownership transition alternatives, the options can vary based upon how much control the owner wants to relinquish,&rdquo; said Robert Gross, Senior Managing Director for Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;A management buyout is a good option for the owner who wants to retain some control.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	With a phased management buyout, closely held business owners aren&rsquo;t relinquishing control, but they are setting the stage for the management team to take control of the company over a long period of time. Implementation of a management buyout can begin in three to six months because closely held business owners do not have to rely upon the marketplace to create a transaction &ndash; the transaction is controlled internally. Depending upon the structure of the transaction, some cash may come to the seller immediately with the balance paid over time. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;With an ESOP or management buyout, it is important to recognize these are usually phased transactions,&rdquo; said Gross. &ldquo;It most likely isn&rsquo;t a 100 percent sale in the first transaction. Plus, closely held business owners have to incorporate the time necessary to accomplish the transaction itself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	Finally, one of the limiting factors for closely held business owners is the quality and depth of the management team below them. This might limit the ownership transition alternatives available to them. It&rsquo;s important that closely held business owners know they need a management team with the aptitude to operate the company independently. An ESOP works better if there is a qualified management team in place. </p>
<p>
	By determining the ownership transition timeline sooner rather than later, a business owner reaps the benefits of having a wealth of options available. With the necessary planning, the owner &ndash; and the company itself &ndash; will benefit from greater control over the future of the business. &ldquo;The question for the closely held business owner is, as you consider all of these factors,&rdquo; said Serwinski, &ldquo;What is your ownership transition timeline?&rdquo;</p>

"126","What is Driving the Value of Your Business?","<p>
	Whether selling your business or engaging in a transaction that requires a valuation, knowing what your company is worth will give you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>
	As a business owner, obtaining a business valuation, or appraisal of the company&rsquo;s worth, is perhaps one of the most important things you can do to increase its future value. By going through the valuation process, you will come to understand the drivers that both positively and negatively impact value and you can make any necessary adjustments before it is too late.</p>
<p>
	There is a number of reasons why a business owner might want to obtain a business valuation, including:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Prepare for an acquisition or sale</li>
	<li>
		Plan for retirement</li>
	<li>
		Succession planning</li>
	<li>
		Assist with estate planning/gift tax filings</li>
	<li>
		Buy out a shareholder</li>
	<li>
		Plan for a divorce</li>
	<li>
		Implement an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</li>
	<li>
		Sell shares of owner stock to management or implement a management buyout</li>
	<li>
		Implement an equity incentive plan for key managers</li>
	<li>
		Curiosity</li>
</ol>
<p>
	&ldquo;A valuation is at the heart of a range of business transactions and corporate decisions,&rdquo; said Ken Serwinski, Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;Any strategic business decision requires a detailed company valuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The process of obtaining a fair and accurate valuation is complicated and often fraught with assumptions and differences of opinion, which is why unbiased analysis from a reputable financial advisory company is necessary to ensure the value is based on real data and accurate projections, not emotion or opinion.</p>
<p>
	According to Serwinski, performing a business valuation is more of an art than a science because it is not only based on the company&rsquo;s profitability, but also its efficiency, products, customer base, economic conditions, expected growth and a number of other factors.</p>
<p>
	The process of performing a business valuation begins with a detailed analysis of the company&rsquo;s operations. There are two main approaches to pricing a business:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Income valuation approach:</strong> Analyzes the company&rsquo;s revenue, estimates its future economic returns and &ldquo;converts&rdquo; those returns into a value estimate.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Market comparable approach:</strong> Determines the value of a company by comparing it to similar firms in the marketplace and creating valuation multiples, which are then adjusted against the earnings of the subject company.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	How do you determine which approach best suits your company? It depends on your company&rsquo;s level of uniqueness and stability in the marketplace. Companies with a distinctive business model, but who have detailed income projections, naturally lend themselves to the income valuation approach, while companies with similar organizational structures as businesses that have either been sold or whose stocks have active markets are better off using the market comparable approach. Most companies, however, utilize a combination of both approaches. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Every company has some level of uniqueness, so we always attempt to exercise both approaches on every assignment,&rdquo; said Serwinski. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also important to consider the industry that the company operates in, how mature the company is and its risk levels.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	You&rsquo;ll also need to take into account the general economic climate as well as trends in your industry &ndash; both good and bad. However, by working with a trusted financial advisor who is skilled at valuation, you will not only determine what your company is worth now, but also maximize its value in the future.</p>

"125","What Are Your Ownership Transition Alternatives?","<p>
	There are several paths you can take when it comes time to transition ownership of your business. How do you determine which one is right for you? For an owner of a closely held business, few questions require as much soul&#8208;searching as the issue of whom to transition ownership to when it&rsquo;s time for you to retire. That&rsquo;s understandable, of course. For years, your business has consumed your days and sometimes your nights&ndash; can you count the number of times you were stuck at the office working late? Like one of your children, you want to protect your business, nourish it, help it grow and then give it the freedom to start a new life.</p>
<p>
	But in order to ensure your business will continue to thrive, you need to know your ownership transition alternatives and plan an exit strategy &ndash; sooner, rather than later. Too often, owners of closely held businesses fail to adequately plan for ownership transition &ndash; or plan too late.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Business ownership succession must be planned years in advance,&rdquo; said Robert Gross, Senior Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;If you wait too long, you might limit your choices and have to settle for a solution that is less than perfect. By planning early, you will have more options available to you and you can begin taking the necessary steps to put your plan in place.</p>
<p>
	Several ownership transition alternatives exist:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Transition of ownership to a family member</li>
	<li>
		Sale of the business to a third party</li>
	<li>
		Management buyout (MBO)</li>
	<li>
		Sale to employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</li>
	<li>
		Combination of two or more of the above options</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Because every business is unique, there isn&rsquo;t a tried&#8208;and true &ldquo;default&rdquo; alternative for any business owner. Each option has its own possibilities and limitations, and the alternative that is right for you can only be determined after careful analysis of the following factors:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>Timing </strong>&ndash; When do you plan to retire? This significantly affects which options are available to you.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Financing </strong>&ndash; What sources of financing are available? Does your successor have the cash to purchase the company?</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Leadership </strong>&ndash; Do you have a strong management team in place &ndash; people who are capable of running the business after you&rsquo;re gone? Is your management infrastructure stable enough to entice an outside buyer?</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Third party salability</strong> &ndash; Does the nature of your business lend itself to an acquisition or third party sale?</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Level of uniqueness</strong> &ndash; How unique is your business/industry? Does its success depend on the talents of your managers or employees?</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Value expectations</strong> &ndash; What do you think your company is worth? What is it really worth? Do you need immediate or long&#8208;term liquidity?</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Risk </strong>&ndash; What is your risk comfort level? Do you expect the value of your company to increase (or decrease) over time?</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A good exit strategy will take all of these factors (and more) into consideration. The right choice can only be made after carefully weighing the pros and cons of each alternative as well as addressing your company&rsquo;s overall capital structure to determine whether it can support each possibility. </p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that your ownership transition alternatives are fluid, &ldquo;said Kenneth Serwinski, Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors. &ldquo;You can sell a portion of your company to management, for example, and a portion to an ESOP.&rdquo; </p>
<p>
	Your exit strategy isn&rsquo;t set in stone, either&ndash; it can develop and change over time. &ldquo;Just because you sold a portion of your company to an ESOP doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t sell it to a third party five years from now if someone makes you an offer you can&rsquo;t refuse,&rdquo; said Serwinski. </p>
<p>
	Once you have a complete understanding of every alternative, you can make an informed decision that has the highest likelihood of achieving your personal and business goals. By planning well in advance, you&rsquo;ll not only have more options available to you, but you&rsquo;ll also have the flexibility to modify your exit strategy as needed &ndash; and as a result, the peace of mind of knowing that the future of your business is well taken care of.</p>

"124","Taking Your Company to Market","<p>
	If you&rsquo;ve ever sold a home, you know how complicated it can be &ndash; the seemingly endless paperwork, the frantic attempts to clean the house before a last&#8208;minute showing, the frustrations of negotiation. Selling a business is even more complex &ndash; and unlike residential real estate, there is no central resource of businesses that are for sale. So as a business owner, how do you find the right buyer?</p>
<p>
	The first step is to hire a financial advisory firm that you trust. An experienced advisor will be an invaluable partner throughout the entire sale process, bringing buyers to the table and helping you maximize the purchase price. But not all advisors are created equal.</p>
<p>
	Here are some qualities to look for in a reputable advisor:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		A verifiable track record &ndash; Good advisors should have a complete list of past transactions, including a list of references that you are free to contact.</li>
	<li>
		An established network of prospective buyers &ndash;This includes access to numerous marketplaces and key contacts within your industry. The advisor should also have the ability to reach buyers who might not be accessible via traditional channels, such as private equity groups and investors.</li>
	<li>
		Double vision &ndash; In order to gauge transaction viability, the advisor should conduct an objective and candid review of your company as it is seen through your eyes, as well as the eyes of prospective buyers.<br />
		Understanding both the buy side and sell side of transaction will help the advisor find the best match for your business.</li>
	<li>
		Knowledge of your industry &ndash; The sale of a business is not just an exercise in numbers. While any advisor can do the math, the best advisor gains a solid understanding of your business, including the industry you operate in and any potential threats to growth and earnings. This is the only way to predict future profitability and in turn, convey that information to potential buyers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Once you have secured a trusted advisor, the sale process begins with the collection and analysis of your company&rsquo;s financial and descriptive data. This leads to two other parallel phases: buyer identification and preparation of the descriptive memorandum and executive summary.</p>
<p>
	Buyer identification includes determining who might have a strategic interest in the company. Sometimes this group includes competitors, vendors, customers or other firms seeking to expand vertically or geographically into the business. Are there companies with a similar product base or facilities as yours? The advisor should also identify whether there are any financial buyers who might want to add the company to their portfolios. These potential buyers should be compiled into a &quot;smart list&quot; that is tiered and reviewed with you to determine if any additions or deletions should be made.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as simple as taking out ads in the Sunday newspaper or sending out mailers,&rdquo; said Kenneth Serwinski, Senior Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors, Inc. &ldquo;The smart list is carefully cultivated from highly qualified prospective buyers. We do a fair amount of heavy lifting in terms of scrubbing the list so we can identify a strategic connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	While the smart list is being polished, the advisor will prepare a descriptive memorandum, which anticipates as many of the prospective buyer&rsquo;s questions as possible. A brief and anonymous executive summary is culled from the memorandum to give prospects a sense of the opportunity, which is sent to prospects prior to the execution of a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The goal is to pique the interest of prospective buyers without revealing important confidential information too soon,&rdquo; said Robert Gross, Senior Managing Director of Prairie Capital Advisors.</p>
<p>
	Once the smart list is approved, &ldquo;blind&rdquo; contact is made. Prospective buyers interested in learning more about your company are then required to enter into a non&#8208;disclosure agreement; once that is in place, they are sent the descriptive memorandum and given a deadline for their initial written expression of interest. The prospects are then screened further and those that are deemed probable buyers are scheduled for due diligence. &ldquo;As financial advisors, it&rsquo;s up to us to be continually handicapping the field to ensure the buyer is suitable and capable of getting the deal done,&rdquo; Gross said.</p>
<p>
	Finally, a deadline is set for the delivery of letters of intent from multiple parties. Your advisor will help you review the offers, understand their differences and choose the best one. &ldquo;By the time you receive the letters of intent, you&rsquo;re only halfway home,&rdquo; said Serwinski. &ldquo;There is still considerable negotiation and due diligence that must take place.&rdquo;</p>

"123","The Pros and Cons of ESOPs: Weighing Your Options","<p>
	For the owners of closely held businesses considering ownership transition, the number of ownership transition options available may not be known. Options can include a sale to a third party, a management buyout (MBO), transition to family, or an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). For many business owners, an ESOP can be an attractive alternative due to its numerous benefits. A host of<br />
	factors will influence which option is best for each owner&rsquo;s unique situation, but for those seriously considering an ESOP, it is important to begin with a basic understanding of the pros and cons of an ESOP.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>What Is An ESOP?</strong><br />
	An ESOP is a qualified employee benefit plan that provides an internal transition of ownership with financial rewards for the business owner and the employees. An ESOP trust is established to purchase stock from selling shareholders. The ESOP may borrow money to facilitate the purchase, which can be repaid by contributions the ESOP receives from the company. Shares of stock are then allocated to employee accounts based on their compensation levels. As long as an employee remains an employee of the company he/she will become increasingly vested in his/her account. An ESOP can help to ensure the continuation of the business, which is important to many owners who have worked so hard for so many years to grow their businesses.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>The Pros</strong><br />
	An ESOP is scalable over time and offers a great degree of flexibility and advantages, a number of which follow.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		For a business owner, an ESOP allows for a greater deal of internal control over the transaction and can take less time to implement when compared to an external sale.</li>
	<li>
		With an ESOP, the business owner can decide if he/she wants to sell all ownership or instead transition ownership gradually over time. Utilization of an ESOP to create liquidity for a minority stake does not preclude an owner from selling the company to a third party in the future.</li>
	<li>
		ESOPs can help business owners gradually begin the process of converting their closely held ownership over to liquid, diversified capital.</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP is an ideal way to vest employees in the company and boost morale. The opportunity to share in company growth and performance gives employees a sense of ownership, with the potential to invigorate their contribution to the success of the business.</li>
	<li>
		Finally, there are a number of attractive tax and investment benefits with an ESOP. The loan used to finance the ESOP transaction is effectively repaid by the company with pre&#8208;tax dollars. In the case of a C&#8208;Corp, a selling shareholder can indefinitely defer capital gains taxes associated with the sale of his/her shares. And for S&#8208;Corps, the ESOP&rsquo;s share of recognized earnings is tax exempt.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>The Cons</strong><br />
	Although there are numerous benefits to an ESOP, they do require understanding of a unique combination of fields such as valuation, business transaction dynamics, tax law, regulatory compliance under ERISA and more. After all, the company is supporting a leveraged buy&#8208;out of its shareholders. The perceived complexity of an ESOP can prove to be a detractor when deciding whether or not to implement an ESOP. Other detractors can include the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Current shareholders are unlikely to maximize proceeds from a sale to an ESOP. The ESOP is a financial buyer, not a strategic buyer.</li>
	<li>
		One hundred percent cash at closing is an unlikely scenario in today&rsquo;s lending environment and seller financing is common.</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP requires ongoing administrative costs, including annual valuation, plan administration and trustee fees.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<strong>Proper Guidance Is Key</strong><br />
	While an ESOP can seem complicated and present unique challenges, ESOPs can be a highly effective tool for ownership transition with a host of advantages for business owners. Most often, the tax, financial and cultural advantages far outweigh the effort of implementation. The best advice for any business owner is to consult a trusted ESOP expert like Prairie Capital Advisors, Inc. With a thorough understanding of all of the ESOP pros and cons, business owners can gain the understanding of how an ESOP will affect their ownership transition plans so they can make an informed, confident decision they can be happy with now and for the long term.</p>

"87","So, You're An ESOP Trustee","<p align=""center"">
	<strong>So, You&rsquo;re An ESOP Trustee</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">
	By Tracy E. Woolsey and Glenn W. Ball</p>
<p>
	Many trust companies and departments find themselves acting as trustees for a relatively small number of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs). These plans are highly regulated and require a trustee to be very knowledgeable about all aspects of plan design and administration as well as the fiduciary duties trustees are expected to fulfill. Many ESOP trustees do not realize the liability they are assuming by acting as trustees. ESOP trustees are held to the highest fiduciary standard under the law and are responsible for what they know or <em>should have</em> known. In this article, we will present a three-dimensional perspective of common fiduciary risks facing an ESOP trustee: First, we will describe the risk itself; second, we will discuss the fiduciary obligations involved; and third, we will outline actions the trustee can take to mitigate the risk going forward.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Noncompliance with Plan Documents or ERISA</strong></p>
<p>
	As a &ldquo;named fiduciary,&rdquo; an ESOP trustee must act for the &ldquo;exclusive benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries,&rdquo; act prudently, and act in accordance with plan documents. One caveat to this last duty: A trustee must act in accordance with the documents governing the plan only to the extent that the documents are consistent with Title I of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). It is incumbent upon the fiduciary to have a sufficient understanding of ERISA to determine whether plan documents are in compliance.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The ESOP trustee must become familiar with the documents underpinning an employee stock ownership trust, such as the plan document and the trust agreement. As mentioned earlier, the trustee is held responsible for ensuring that the plan is operated in accordance with the plan document as well as with the rules set forth in ERISA. Even in the case of a &ldquo;directed&rdquo; trustee, whereby the trustee is subject to the direction of another named fiduciary such as the plan administrator, care must be taken to ensure that the instructions from the other fiduciary are consistent with the plan. For example, if the plan prohibits a certain kind of investment, the directed trustee should not make the investment, even if so instructed.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The ERISA directive to ensure that &ldquo;the plan is operated in accordance with plan documents and ERISA&rdquo; is very broad. The ESOP trustee&rsquo;s role can include a variety of decision-making activities with respect to ERISA, and the trustee could be sued for a fiduciary breach of conduct with regard to the following, among others:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		failing to allow employees to vote their shares on required issues</li>
	<li>
		failing to give employees appropriate information on which to base a decision when they vote</li>
	<li>
		failing to distribute benefits according to plan rules</li>
	<li>
		acting in a discriminatory manner in honoring the put option</li>
	<li>
		failing to ensure the filing of reports when such failure could result in the plan&rsquo;s losing its qualified status</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Beyond a trustee having a good understanding of the plan documents and ERISA, another way to reduce risk is to retain legal counsel (independent of the plan sponsor) that acts as the trustee&rsquo;s counsel but is paid by the plan sponsor or trust. In fact, ERISA states that an ESOP fiduciary has an obligation to seek the assistance of an expert to satisfy the prudence requirement referenced in the preceding paragraph. Trustee&rsquo;s counsel is typically called upon sporadically, on an as-needed basis, for issues ranging from ERISA compliance questions to helping the trustee navigate the waters of a terminated participant lawsuit.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Setting the Share Price</strong></p>
<p>
	One of the most important functions an ESOP trustee of a closely held company performs is setting the fair market value of the plan sponsor&rsquo;s stock. Federal law stipulates that appraisals of ESOP company stock should be performed, at a minimum, on an annual basis, corresponding to the end of each plan year. The trustee will normally retain an independent financial advisor (a valuation expert) to perform an in-depth stock analysis and issue a written report. The trustee will typically rely on the appraiser&rsquo;s expertise, but the ultimate responsibility for setting the share price remains with the trustee. It is not uncommon for the trustee to recommend changes in the appraiser&rsquo;s methodology, assumptions, or even conclusion of value. Ultimately, the trustee can be held liable for claims that the share price was either over- or undervalued. The best way to mitigate this risk is for the trustee to have a good understanding of the valuation discipline, play an active role in the valuation process, and thoroughly document the process used to arrive at fair market value. The determination of the fair market value of a closely held entity is highly subjective. Therefore, it is important to show that a reasonable process was followed in arriving at the value conclusion.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Many institutional (i.e., independent) trustees specializing in ESOP trusteeships have committees&#9472;consisting of legal, financial, and retirement plan specialists within their organizations&#9472;that review all valuation reports and are charged with setting the share price. Although they are known as valuation experts, appraisers are not infallible, and it sometimes takes the critical eye of the trustee to point out flaws or incorrect assumptions embedded in the appraiser&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Case law has established that ESOP trustees will not be shielded from liability for overvaluing or undervaluing employee stock when it has been determined that the trustee passively accepted a valuation report. The key risk mitigator in ESOP valuations appears to be the soundness of the trustee&rsquo;s review process, which includes investigating the appraiser&rsquo;s qualifications at the outset, performing a thorough due diligence review of the plan sponsor (including a site visit), providing the appraiser with complete and accurate information, and making certain that reliance on the appraiser&rsquo;s advice is reasonably justified under the circumstances. There may be rare occasions when a trustee, unable to get comfortable with the appraiser&rsquo;s value conclusion, will retain a second independent expert to either review the first valuation or go so far as to perform a second appraisal.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Valuation issues are one of the primary causes of significant ESOP problems. Sudden changes in price can lead to participants&rsquo; bringing suit against the trustee. Also, in recent years the Department of Labor (DOL) has increased its scrutiny of ESOP valuation reports. In closely held businesses, the best defense a trustee can offer is a well-documented process for determining the share price.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Verifying the Share Release Calculation for a Leveraged ESOP</strong></p>
<p>
	The DOL has indicated that it is a fiduciary obligation to verify that the share release calculation performed by the plan&rsquo;s administrator was performed correctly. Simply put, failure to verify this number could result in legal exposure for the trustee. Specifically, the trustee must verify that the ESOP record keeper&rsquo;s share release calculation is correct in the context of a leveraged plan. Most ESOP companies retain third-party administrators to handle the plan accounting and retirement plan compliance requirements [e.g., 409(p) testing]. One of the record keeper&rsquo;s responsibilities is to calculate the number of shares to be released from the suspense account (if any) and allocated to individual participant accounts, as of the end of each plan year based on loan payments made during the prior year. The suspense account holds shares that are owned by the trust but not yet allocated to individual accounts. While the trustee must verify that the number of shares released from the suspense account is correct, fiduciary duty does not extend to verifying the accuracy of allocations to individual accounts. In general terms, an ESOP trustee&rsquo;s responsibility rests with the plan&rsquo;s assets as a whole.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Potential Conflicts of Interest</strong></p>
<p>
	Conflicts may arise when the institutional trustee (often a bank or trust company) has other bank or trust products with the plan sponsor, its shareholders, or its management. A common potential conflict of interest seen with ESOPs is when the trustee (i.e., bank) is also asked to play the role of lender to the ESOP or the company. The DOL has interpreted the requirement that fiduciaries of an employee benefit plan must act &ldquo;solely in the interest&rdquo; of the plan participants and of their beneficiaries as prohibiting a bank that has loans outstanding with a particular company for serving as the trustee of that company&rsquo;s ESOP. However, there have been several federal court of appeals decisions that found the dual role of lender/trustee to be acceptable.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A similar example of a conflict of interest, though seemingly innocuous, is when a sponsor company chooses as its trustee a financial institution with which it has an existing relationship, such as demand deposit accounts. While ERISA does not expressly prohibit conflicts of interest, allegations of improper conduct (by the ESOP trustee) will be given the benefit of the doubt. To avoid any appearance of impropriety, many institutional ESOP trustees systematically avoid any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In general terms, fiduciaries with conflicts of interest are required to subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the participants in the plan. Back in 1982, the U.S. Second Circuit Court interpreted the &ldquo;exclusive benefit rule&rdquo; to mean that a fiduciary&rsquo;s decisions must be made &ldquo;with an eye single to the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Another court has developed a test consisting of three questions that the court must answer to determine whether a plan fiduciary has violated the exclusive benefit requirement:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Was the conflict of interest so great that it was virtually impossible for the fiduciary to discharge his or her duties in a manner for the benefit of participants or beneficiaries?</li>
	<li>
		If there was a potential conflict of interest, was the fiduciary engaged in an intense and independent investigation of options to ensure that the action taken was in the participants&rsquo; best interests?</li>
	<li>
		To what extent did the use of the plan assets track the best interests of another party (other than the plan participants)?</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Penalties for Noncompliance</strong></p>
<p>
	A breach of fiduciary duty may constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA Section 406, Code Section 4975, or both. Code Section 4975 imposes an excise tax equal to 15 percent of the amount involved in the prohibited transaction for each year, or part of a year, in which the transaction remains uncorrected. An additional tax equal to 100 percent of the amount involved is imposed if the prohibited transaction is not corrected within the correction period.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Can a plan trustee be reimbursed for the legal expenses incurred in defending a lawsuit charging breach of fiduciary duties? With the exception of a recent prominent court case decision (<em>Johnson v. Couturier)</em>, the answer is yes. Prior to the <em>Couturier</em> decision, the company typically reimbursed a fiduciary&rsquo;s legal expenses, according to provisions in standard engagement agreements. However, as we&rsquo;ve learned from the <em>Couturier</em> decision, at least one court appears willing to override indemnification provisions when the case&rsquo;s fact set dictates. It is too soon to tell what impact the <em>Couturier </em>case will have in terms of case law precedent and the future risk landscape for ESOP trustees, but it has already been cited in another case as a reason not to honor indemnification. It is important to also note that if a fiduciary is found to have acted willfully or negligently, the company would need to be reimbursed by the trustees for these expenses.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></p>
<p>
	Strict standards are in place for fiduciaries and any breach of their responsibilities can result in lawsuits and statutory penalties. A first line of defense against risk exposure for an ESOP trustee is insurance coverage. Many wrongly assume that this type of coverage is included in their D&amp;O policies. In fact, most D&amp;O policies exclude fiduciary liability exposures as well as exposures pertaining to ERISA. There are two types of coverage available to ESOP trustees:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		a fiduciary liability policy</li>
	<li>
		a fidelity bond</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Fiduciary liability insurance provides protection for losses that the insured is legally obligated to pay because of a claim made for a wrongful act. Most policies define this to include any violation of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed on fiduciaries by ERISA. The policy also typically includes coverage for defense costs in connection with a covered claim. A common misconception about fiduciary liability insurance is that a fidelity bond will cover your fiduciary exposure. The ERISA/fidelity bond protects the plan assets from misuse or misappropriation, but it does not protect the fiduciaries.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Also, it is often assumed that fiduciary liability insurance provides blanket coverage. In some policies, ESOPs are actually specifically excluded from coverage, or any external trustee is excluded. If you act as an ESOP trustee, you should verify that your insurance policy does not exclude ESOPs and that you are not relying on coverage that applies only to the company.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A final point on insurance coverage: There has been a lot of confusion regarding the differences between fiduciary liability insurance and employee benefits liability insurance. The latter normally applies only to claims rising out of administrative errors and is very limited. Many insureds think that by having employee benefits coverage, they do not need fiduciary liability coverage. That is definitely not true!</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>
	The following is a list of take-away points from this article that will guide you in your work as an ESOP trustee:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The DOL expects ESOP trustees to verify the share release calculation performed by the plan&rsquo;s administrator.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		ESOP trustees are held to the highest fiduciary standard under the law and are responsible for what they know or should have known.</li>
	<li>
		An ESOP trustee has as its general duties to act for the &ldquo;exclusive benefit of plan participants and beneficiaries,&rdquo; to act prudently and to act in accordance with plan documents, but only to the extent that the documents are consistent with ERISA.</li>
	<li>
		An important way to mitigate fiduciary risk is to retain legal counsel (independent of the plan sponsor) that acts as the trustee&rsquo;s counsel, typically called upon on an as-needed basis.</li>
	<li>
		One of the most important functions an ESOP trustee of a closely held company performs is the setting of the fair market value of the plan sponsor&rsquo;s stock. The best way to mitigate valuation-related risk is for the trustee to have a good understanding of the valuation process, and thoroughly document the process used to arrive at fair market value.</li>
	<li>
		While not expressly in violation of ERISA, conflicts of interest present real risk to the ESOP fiduciary. Allegations of improper conduct by the ESOP trustee will normally be given the benefit of the doubt. Many institutional ESOP trustees systematically avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.</li>
	<li>
		A first line of defense against risk exposure for an ESOP trustee is insurance coverage, including a fidelity bond policy and a fiduciary liability policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Remember, nothing can totally prevent lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny, but proper management practices and a complete insurance program can go a long way in limiting your risk.</p>

"26","ESOP Governance and their Ownership Culture","<p>
	Governance in the Dictionary means: &ldquo;to Govern.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Dictionary term for Govern is: &ldquo;to direct the actions and behaviors of others.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the stories of Enron and others relating to bad governance and Sarbanes Oxley impacting public companies, what should an ESOP company board do with potential liabilities involving the DOL?&nbsp;&nbsp; My answer is: &ldquo;if you have a functioning board including committees, composed of at least one independent director with deep experience in board governance&hellip; probably nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you don&rsquo;t have this, are you really taking advantage of the best practices that enable ESOP companies to exceed where other companies fail?&nbsp; Governance is NOT a legal issue for an ESOP company, it is an Ownership issue. <br />
	<br />
	Governance isn&rsquo;t all about boards of directors either.&nbsp; There are Trustees who elect the board members on behalf of the trust beneficiaries, namely the employees.&nbsp; If you are a stockholder, who is a senior executive of the company, and sits on the board, you are exposing yourself to a nasty surprise if something goes wrong.&nbsp; The DOL will be looking very closely at conflicts of interest in any governance areas.&nbsp; Therefore, I suggest there should be a governance committee formed to identify and resolve those conflicts, identify candidates for directorship, establish a board charter and to develop a director orientation process to educate and enable a good directors to perform sooner than later.<br />
	<br />
	Let&rsquo;s talk about what are some of the best practices an ESOP company could do to make their governance improve company performance.&nbsp; I am mindful that owners of companies, who desire to use the 1042 rollover, want to enable a succession or estate plan that recognizes the employees who have helped develop their value.&nbsp; So what is the succession plan?&nbsp; The Trustees will elect people to a board with an expectation that succession plan will be developed, and that the company will not fold if the owner or founder &ldquo;suddenly disappears.&rdquo; <br />
	<br />
	Succession is not just about picking the next CEO.&nbsp; How deep is the management team in being effective managers?&nbsp; A founder reached success by managing risk; so, who is ready to do that if he/she leaves or retires?&nbsp; Do the middle managers understand their career paths to grow with the company?&nbsp; I believe this is the NUMBER ONE responsibility for a board to deal with.&nbsp; Just think back to the basics.&nbsp; If you were sitting on a board with an EXCELLENT management team, deep with effective managers, should you be concerned with day to day operations?&nbsp; Should you be seeing a lack of financial performance or major surprises that could have been avoided?&nbsp; Probably NOT. Having a GREAT succession plan allows boards to focus on the important stuff like: what are the key items that are holding the company back from growing profitably?&nbsp; Where are the new markets the company should be moving towards?&nbsp; What new investments should be made to improve sales and profitability?&nbsp; How can their wisdom improve performance?<br />
	<br />
	When identifying or selecting possible Management candidates, there is always the issue of compensation for that or those individuals.&nbsp; Therefore, a board should have a compensation committee reviewing the key people, as they may have to select one of them to be CEO someday.&nbsp; A compensation committee would also review benefits structure and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, other forms of rewards would also be under their purview.&nbsp; This committee is not the H/R function of the company, but the policy maker.<br />
	<br />
	One other important committee is the Finance or Audit committee.&nbsp; Unlike publicly held companies, ESOP boards aren&rsquo;t required to have financial experts as chairs of the committees.&nbsp; I do suggest that at least one member have some financial experience beyond the CFO as there may be times when that will be needed.&nbsp; Areas this committee could be looking into are reporting, banking, the annual report and valuation, as well as management letters by the CPA, budgeting, forecasts, and investment/capital expenditure opportunities.<br />
	<br />
	Boards usually meet quarterly, to review progress from previous presentations from the management team.&nbsp; As agenda&rsquo;s are fairly tight, there are several key items to cover as a theme for the meeting.&nbsp; In the spring, it should be the annual results and valuation, the summer board meeting should cover the company&rsquo;s strategy and strategic plan, the fall meeting should cover compensation and future investments based on changes to the strategic plan, and the winter should be budgets, forecasts the management team developed.&nbsp; Committees should meet more frequently to cover details more closely.<br />
	<br />
	Finally, one of the things I learned years ago was that great boards &ldquo;don&rsquo;t touch, they sniff.&rdquo;&nbsp; That means if they must &ldquo;touch&rdquo; or manage the management team, they have the wrong people managing the company.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sniffing&rdquo; represents the desire to learn, to stick your head close to the issue, but not managing it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Great boards want their managers to learn from their experience, not to be managed by it.&nbsp; Great boards have great managers because the directors are engaged with the managers in open discussion with challenges. Directors are great mentors for senior management. Management must drive change, and use the board&rsquo;s experience to avoid the typical mistakes that companies make without effective boards.&nbsp; Senior managers must develop middle management to ensure continuity and predictable performance.&nbsp; Resistance is usually found in middle management, and thus good managers know how to correct resistance, so that change can occur. <br />
	<br />
	The reason Governance is an Ownership issue, is that you now realize that everyone, from the employee to the trustee and all in between, needs to be on the same page, working together with common goals and pursuits. Each person has a role, and the lack of using their roles effectively creates dysfunction and non performance.&nbsp; Accountability is inherent within a Governance process, therefore, people must act their roles, and develop great communication systems and skills.&nbsp; Good Governance creates function and form that allow people to perform as expected and with success.&nbsp; This is not &ldquo;touchy-feely&rdquo; stuff.&nbsp; It is the concrete foundation a company needs to weather various storms.</p>

"180","Ownership Transition of Large Distribution Company","<h2 style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif;"">
	The Problem</h2>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	In 1975, our client acquired one of the largest distribution companies in their industry. He had been the sole owner of this Houston-based company for 42 years, built a strong management team, and structured the organization as a C-Corporation. The organization owned both the business and the real estate on which the business operates.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	At 70 years old and in excellent health, our client wanted to continue working but also needed an exit strategy. Because his children were not interested in taking over the business, he required a unique solution that would enable him to sell the company and still maintain some control.</p>
<h2 style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif;"">
	The Solution</h2>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	<em>GBH suggested a structured sale of his stock to company employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).</em></p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	An ESOP is a Trust that buys and holds the company&#39;s stock for the benefit of the employees. The Trustee of the ESOP Trust votes the shares of the ESOP.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	The law allows, and GBH recommended that our client (now the Seller of his own company) be appointed as Trustee of the Trust, thus enabling him to maintain control of the company and continue to work as long as he desired.</p>
<h2 style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif;"">
	Impact on the Owner</h2>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	Our client sold the stock of his corporation to the ESOP Trust. Had the owner sold to a third party, the buyer would have insisted on an asset sale because of tax reasons. Although the agreed price for the assets may have been as much as $20 million, the seller would have received about $12.5 million after taxes.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	The sale of stock to the ESOP qualified for the &quot;1042 rollover&quot; which allows certain sellers of shares of a C-Corporation to an ESOP can elect to defer taxes on the gain if the seller invests the proceeds in stocks or bonds of domestic corporations. In this case, our client made the election and did not pay tax on the gain.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	Prior to the sale of the Company&#39;s stock to the ESOP, the land and buildings were removed from the corporation in a tax-free transaction. Our client then leased the property to his former company on a long-term basis at market value. This lease structure was anticipated in the valuation and the transaction price.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	Post transaction, the company elected to be taxed as an S-Corporation. An S-Corporation pays not taxes on its income. Instead, its shareholders pay the taxes on their share of earnings. Post transaction, the company had one shareholder (the ESOP Trust), which is a non-taxable entity. As a result, the company, Trust, and Trust beneficiaries are not required to pay income tax.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	The sale was financed by a combination of new bank debt and seller debt, a structure which is common in many sales of private companies. However, the seller believes that he will collect the entire note because 1) cash flow is better since there is not a tax cost and 2) The seller remains in control of the business.</p>
<h2 style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif;"">
	Impact on Employees</h2>
<p style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Bitstream Charter&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 16px;"">
	<em>The value of the company is being transferred to the employees as the ESOP debt is repaid. Upon retirement, participants will have a retirement benefit from the ESOP.</em></p>

"158","Re-Balancing an ESOP","<p>
	A long-standing OneAmerica ESOP client wanted to add rebalancing to their ESOP.&nbsp; Rebalancing is a technique used in ESOPs that have both stock and some other investments (such as cash) within the plan and basically allows an employer to rebalance the accounts of all participants in such a way that they all end up with the same proportion of employer securities.&nbsp; So, for example, if the plan has 90% of its assets in company stock, rebalancing (which must be stated in the plan document) allows the employer to transfer stock in and out of participant accounts to get everyone to have 90% of their account balance invested in stock.&nbsp; In 2009, the IRS clarified that this process was permitted (see Request for Technical Assistance April 3, 2009).&nbsp; In the case of our client with a 100% ESOP, many participants that had been hired a while ago had a large percentage of employer stock.&nbsp; However, newer participants were lacking in employer stock and had a higher percentage of cash in their accounts.&nbsp; While there are advantages and disadvantages to applying rebalancing to participant accounts (not to be covered within this case study), the client felt with proper communication, they wanted to be able to apply rebalancing.&nbsp; Note that we are the administrator/recordkeeper for this plan, and they use outside legal counsel for the plan document.&nbsp; The outside legal counsel drafted an amendment to add the rebalancing, and the client shared it with our ESOP team.&nbsp; We reviewed the amendment and walked through it in detail with the client.&nbsp; We indicated that we would do an initial allocation first, and then rebalance, taking into account distributions and diversifications before doing any rebalancing.&nbsp; Also, we clarified that if anyone was subject to a 1042 election and excluded from future allocations, their accounts would not be rebalanced.&nbsp; We talked through this process with this client so they could finalize the amendment with their counsel to their satisfaction and proceed to rebalance.&nbsp; They were happy to receive this consulting and move forward to accomplish their goals.</p>

"157","ESOP has a 404 deduction issue","<p>
	OneAmerica was involved in a finalist presentation for a prospective 401(k) and DB client (1 401(k) $25mm, 2 DBs totaling $25mm).&nbsp; As it turned out, they also had an ESOP but that plan was not on the table.&nbsp; At the end of the presentation, the CFO mentioned that they had a 404 deduction issue with their ESOP.&nbsp; Their employee base had faced reduction, resulting in a corresponding reduction in their covered compensation, so their ESOP (inside) loan payment was now larger than their maximum 404 deduction limit, generating excise taxes for them.&nbsp; As the ESOP expert in attendance, my initial reaction was to verify S or C Corporation status and suggest on the spot to use earnings distribution (they are an S Corporation) as loan payments, because earnings distributions are &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; and not &ldquo;contributions&rdquo; so they do not count toward the 404 deduction limit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The CFO already knew about this strategy, and it was not viable because the allocation of share release on loan payments from earnings distributions are made pro-rata on a share balance basis, and they did not want more shares going to those who already had the most shares.&nbsp; After returning home and discussing with our OneAmerica ESOP team, we brainstormed about lowering the interest rate on the ESOP loan, and how that would reduce their loan payments.&nbsp; Even better, if the loan payments were level payments (not level principal but level payments), then lowering the interest rate would not change the share release.&nbsp; Turns out their loan rate was over 4%, and they did have level payments, so we suggested lowering this interest rate.&nbsp; As a result of our suggestion, and after consultation with their ESOP attorney, they were able to lower their interest rate and thus lower their loan payments, which helped them resolve their 404 deduction issue.&nbsp; We did win the 401(k) and DB business, and we continue to work with them on ESOP consulting, hoping to win that plan too.</p>

	A new ESOP was preparing for its closing. The 100% owner was trying to decide whether to take <br />
	a 1042 election and defer the capital gains (which would mean that he and his son would be excluded from participating in the ESOP) or to not take 1042 and be included in the ESOP with his son. The financial advisor asked us to project the next 25 years of allocations to the owner and his son as compared to them not being included in the ESOP. We were given census data and a future stock price projection, the amount of the loan, and number of shares to do our projection. We created a spreadsheet and did this projection to the satisfaction of everyone, and it allowed the owner to make a good financial decision.</p>
